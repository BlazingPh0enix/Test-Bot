About Physics
This instructional material was initially created through a
Texas Education Agency (TEA) initiative to provide highquality open-source instructional materials to districts free
of charge. Funds were allocated by the 84th Texas Legislature
(2015) for the creation of state-developed, open-source
instructional materials with the request that advanced
secondary courses supporting the study of science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics should be
prioritized.

Physics covers the scope and sequence requirements of a
typical one-year physics course. The text provides
comprehensive coverage of physical concepts, quantitative
examples and skills, and interesting applications. High
School Physics has been designed to meet and exceed the
requirements of the relevant Texas Essential Knowledge and
Skills (TEKS (http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/
chapter112/ch112c.html#112.39) ), while allowing significant
flexibility for instructors.
Qualified and experienced Texas faculty were involved
throughout the development process, and the textbooks were
reviewed extensively to ensure effectiveness and usability in
each course. Reviewers considered each resource’s clarity,
accuracy, student support, assessment rigor and
appropriateness, alignment to TEKS, and overall quality.
Their invaluable suggestions provided the basis for
continually improved material and helped to certify that the
books are ready for use. The writers and reviewers also
considered common course issues, effective teaching
strategies, and student engagement to provide instructors
and students with useful, supportive content and drive
effective learning experiences.

Coverage and scope

Physics presents physical laws, research, concepts, and skills
in a logical and engaging progression that should be familiar

1

2

Preface

to most physics faculty. The textbook begins with a general
introduction to physics and scientific processes, which is
followed by several chapters on motion and Newton’s laws.
After mechanics, the students will move through
thermodynamics, waves and sound, and light and optics.
Electricity and magnetism and nuclear physics complete the
textbook.

CHAPTER 1

What is Physics?

Figure 1.1 Galaxies, such as the Andromeda galaxy pictured here, are immense in size. The small blue spots in this
photo are also galaxies. The same physical laws apply to objects as large as galaxies or objects as small as atoms.
The laws of physics are, therefore, surprisingly few in number. (NASA, JPL-Caltech, P. Barmby, Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics).

Chapter Outline
1.1 Physics: Definitions and Applications
1.2 The Scientific Methods
1.3 The Language of Physics: Physical Quantities and Units

INTRODUCTION Take a look at the image above of the Andromeda Galaxy (Figure 1.1), which contains billions of stars. This
galaxy is the nearest one to our own galaxy (the Milky Way) but is still a staggering 2.5 million light years from Earth. (A light
year is a measurement of the distance light travels in a year.) Yet, the primary force that affects the movement of stars within
Andromeda is the same force that we contend with here on Earth—namely, gravity.
You may soon realize that physics plays a much larger role in your life than you thought. This section introduces you to the realm
of physics, and discusses applications of physics in other disciplines of study. It also describes the methods by which science is
done, and how scientists communicate their results to each other.

1.1 Physics: Definitions and Applications
Section Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Describe the definition, aims, and branches of physics
• Describe and distinguish classical physics from modern physics and describe the importance of relativity,
quantum mechanics, and relativistic quantum mechanics in modern physics
• Describe how aspects of physics are used in other sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, geology, etc.) as well as in
everyday technology

What Physics Is
Think about all of the technological devices that you use on a regular basis. Computers, wireless internet, smart phones, tablets,
global positioning system (GPS), MP3 players, and satellite radio might come to mind. Next, think about the most exciting
modern technologies that you have heard about in the news, such as trains that levitate above their tracks, invisibility cloaks that
bend light around them, and microscopic robots that fight diseased cells in our bodies. All of these groundbreaking
advancements rely on the principles of physics.
Physics is a branch of science. The word science comes from a Latin word that means having knowledge, and refers the
knowledge of how the physical world operates, based on objective evidence determined through observation and
experimentation. A key requirement of any scientific explanation of a natural phenomenon is that it must be testable; one must
be able to devise and conduct an experimental investigation that either supports or refutes the explanation. It is important to
note that some questions fall outside the realm of science precisely because they deal with phenomena that are not scientifically
testable. This need for objective evidence helps define the investigative process scientists follow, which will be described later in
this chapter.
Physics is the science aimed at describing the fundamental aspects of our universe. This includes what things are in it, what
properties of those things are noticeable, and what processes those things or their properties undergo. In simpler terms, physics
attempts to describe the basic mechanisms that make our universe behave the way it does. For example, consider a smart phone
(Figure 1.2). Physics describes how electric current interacts with the various circuits inside the device. This knowledge helps
engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when building the smart phone. Next, consider a GPS. Physics
describes the relationship between the speed of an object, the distance over which it travels, and the time it takes to travel that
distance. When you use a GPS device in a vehicle, it utilizes these physics relationships to determine the travel time from one
location to another.

As our technology evolved over the centuries, physics expanded into many branches. Ancient peoples could only study things
that they could see with the naked eye or otherwise experience without the aid of scientific equipment. This included the study
of kinematics, which is the study of moving objects. For example, ancient people often studied the apparent motion of objects in
the sky, such as the sun, moon, and stars. This is evident in the construction of prehistoric astronomical observatories, such as
Stonehenge in England (shown in Figure 1.3).

Figure 1.3 Stonehenge is a monument located in England that was built between 3000 and 1000 B.C. It functions as an ancient
astronomical observatory, with certain rocks in the monument aligning with the position of the sun during the summer and winter solstices.
Other rocks align with the rising and setting of the moon during certain days of the year. (Citypeek, Wikimedia Commons)

Ancient people also studied statics and dynamics, which focus on how objects start moving, stop moving, and change speed and
direction in response to forces that push or pull on the objects. This early interest in kinematics and dynamics allowed humans
to invent simple machines, such as the lever, the pulley, the ramp, and the wheel. These simple machines were gradually

Chapter 1 • What is Physics?

combined and integrated to produce more complicated machines, such as wagons and cranes. Machines allowed humans to
gradually do more work more effectively in less time, allowing them to create larger and more complicated buildings and
structures, many of which still exist today from ancient times.
As technology advanced, the branches of physics diversified even more. These include branches such as acoustics, the study of
sound, and optics, the study of the light. In 1608, the invention of the telescope by a Germany spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey,
led to huge breakthroughs in astronomy—the study of objects or phenomena in space. One year later, in 1609, Galileo Galilei
began the first studies of the solar system and the universe using a telescope. During the Renaissance era, Isaac Newton used
observations made by Galileo to construct his three laws of motion. These laws were the standard for studying kinematics and
dynamics even today.
Another major branch of physics is thermodynamics, which includes the study of thermal energy and the transfer of heat. James
Prescott Joule, an English physicist, studied the nature of heat and its relationship to work. Joule’s work helped lay the
foundation for the first of three laws of thermodynamics that describe how energy in our universe is transferred from one object
to another or transformed from one form to another. Studies in thermodynamics were motivated by the need to make engines
more efficient, keep people safe from the elements, and preserve food.
The 18th and 19th centuries also saw great strides in the study of electricity and magnetism. Electricity involves the study of
electric charges and their movements. Magnetism had long ago been noticed as an attractive force between a magnetized object
and a metal like iron, or between the opposite poles (North and South) of two magnetized objects. In 1820, Danish physicist
Hans Christian Oersted showed that electric currents create magnetic fields. In 1831, English inventor Michael Faraday showed
that moving a wire through a magnetic field could induce an electric current. These studies led to the inventions of the electric
motor and electric generator, which revolutionized human life by bringing electricity and magnetism into our machines.
The end of the 19th century saw the discovery of radioactive substances by the French scientists Marie and Pierre Curie. Nuclear
physics involves studying the nuclei of atoms, the source of nuclear radiation. In the 20th century, the study of nuclear physics
eventually led to the ability to split the nucleus of an atom, a process called nuclear fission. This process is the basis for nuclear
power plants and nuclear weapons. Also, the field of quantum mechanics, which involves the mechanics of atoms and
molecules, saw great strides during the 20th century as our understanding of atoms and subatomic particles increased (see
below).
Early in the 20th century, Albert Einstein revolutionized several branches of physics, especially relativity. Relativity
revolutionized our understanding of motion and the universe in general as described further in this chapter. Now, in the 21st
century, physicists continue to study these and many other branches of physics.
By studying the most important topics in physics, you will gain analytical abilities that will enable you to apply physics far
beyond the scope of what can be included in a single book. These analytical skills will help you to excel academically, and they will
also help you to think critically in any career you choose to pursue.

Physics: Past and Present
The word physics is thought to come from the Greek word phusis, meaning nature. The study of nature later came to be called
natural philosophy. From ancient times through the Renaissance, natural philosophy encompassed many fields, including
astronomy, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and medicine. Over the last few centuries, the growth of scientific knowledge has
resulted in ever-increasing specialization and branching of natural philosophy into separate fields, with physics retaining the
most basic facets. Physics, as it developed from the Renaissance to the end of the 19th century, is called classical physics.
Revolutionary discoveries starting at the beginning of the 20th century transformed physics from classical physics to modern
physics.
Classical physics is not an exact description of the universe, but it is an excellent approximation under the following conditions:
(1) matter must be moving at speeds less than about 1 percent of the speed of light, (2) the objects dealt with must be large
enough to be seen with the naked eye, and (3) only weak gravity, such as that generated by Earth, can be involved. Very small
objects, such as atoms and molecules, cannot be adequately explained by classical physics. These three conditions apply to
almost all of everyday experience. As a result, most aspects of classical physics should make sense on an intuitive level.
Many laws of classical physics have been modified during the 20th century, resulting in revolutionary changes in technology,
society, and our view of the universe. As a result, many aspects of modern physics, which occur outside of the range of our
everyday experience, may seem bizarre or unbelievable. So why is most of this textbook devoted to classical physics? There are

1.1 • Physics: Definitions and Applications

two main reasons. The first is that knowledge of classical physics is necessary to understand modern physics. The second reason
is that classical physics still gives an accurate description of the universe under a wide range of everyday circumstances.
Modern physics includes two revolutionary theories: relativity and quantum mechanics. These theories deal with the very fast
and the very small, respectively. The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. By examining how two
observers moving relative to each other would see the same phenomena, Einstein devised radical new ideas about time and
space. He came to the startling conclusion that the measured length of an object travelling at high speeds (greater than about
one percent of the speed of light) is shorter than the same object measured at rest. Perhaps even more bizarre is the idea the
time for the same process to occur is different depending on the motion of the observer. Time passes more slowly for an object
travelling at high speeds. A trip to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, might take an astronaut 4.5 Earth years if the ship
travels near the speed of light. However, because time is slowed at higher speeds, the astronaut would age only 0.5 years during
the trip. Einstein’s ideas of relativity were accepted after they were confirmed by numerous experiments.
Gravity, the force that holds us to Earth, can also affect time and space. For example, time passes more slowly on Earth’s surface
than for objects farther from the surface, such as a satellite in orbit. The very accurate clocks on global positioning satellites have
to correct for this. They slowly keep getting ahead of clocks at Earth’s surface. This is called time dilation, and it occurs because
gravity, in essence, slows down time.
Large objects, like Earth, have strong enough gravity to distort space. To visualize this idea, think about a bowling ball placed on
a trampoline. The bowling ball depresses or curves the surface of the trampoline. If you rolled a marble across the trampoline, it
would follow the surface of the trampoline, roll into the depression caused by the bowling ball, and hit the ball. Similarly, the
Earth curves space around it in the shape of a funnel. These curves in space due to the Earth cause objects to be attracted to
Earth (i.e., gravity).
Because of the way gravity affects space and time, Einstein stated that gravity affects the space-time continuum, as illustrated in
Figure 1.4. This is why time proceeds more slowly at Earth’s surface than in orbit. In black holes, whose gravity is hundreds of
times that of Earth, time passes so slowly that it would appear to a far-away observer to have stopped!

Figure 1.4 Einstein’s theory of relativity describes space and time as an interweaved mesh. Large objects, such as a planet, distort space,
causing objects to fall in toward the planet due to the action of gravity. Large objects also distort time, causing time to proceed at a slower
rate near the surface of Earth compared with the area outside of the distorted region of space-time.

In summary, relativity says that in describing the universe, it is important to realize that time, space and speed are not absolute.
Instead, they can appear different to different observers. Einstein’s ability to reason out relativity is even more amazing because
we cannot see the effects of relativity in our everyday lives.
Quantum mechanics is the second major theory of modern physics. Quantum mechanics deals with the very small, namely, the
subatomic particles that make up atoms. Atoms (Figure 1.5) are the smallest units of elements. However, atoms themselves are
constructed of even smaller subatomic particles, such as protons, neutrons and electrons. Quantum mechanics strives to

9

10

Chapter 1 • What is Physics?

describe the properties and behavior of these and other subatomic particles. Often, these particles do not behave in the ways
expected by classical physics. One reason for this is that they are small enough to travel at great speeds, near the speed of light.

Figure 1.5 Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), scientists can see the individual atoms that compose this sheet of gold.
(Erwinrossen)

At particle colliders (Figure 1.6), such as the Large Hadron Collider on the France-Swiss border, particle physicists can make
subatomic particles travel at very high speeds within a 27 kilometers (17 miles) long superconducting tunnel. They can then study
the properties of the particles at high speeds, as well as collide them with each other to see how they exchange energy. This has
led to many intriguing discoveries such as the Higgs-Boson particle, which gives matter the property of mass, and antimatter,
which causes a huge energy release when it comes in contact with matter.

Figure 1.6 Particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland or Fermilab in the United States (pictured here), have long
tunnels that allows subatomic particles to be accelerated to near light speed. (Andrius.v )

Physicists are currently trying to unify the two theories of modern physics, relativity and quantum mechanics, into a single,
comprehensive theory called relativistic quantum mechanics. Relating the behavior of subatomic particles to gravity, time, and
space will allow us to explain how the universe works in a much more comprehensive way.

Application of Physics
You need not be a scientist to use physics. On the contrary, knowledge of physics is useful in everyday situations as well as in
nonscientific professions. For example, physics can help you understand why you shouldn’t put metal in the microwave (Figure
1.7), why a black car radiator helps remove heat in a car engine, and why a white roof helps keep the inside of a house cool. The
operation of a car’s ignition system, as well as the transmission of electrical signals through our nervous system, are much
easier to understand when you think about them in terms of the basic physics of electricity.

metal. These moving electrons can create an electrical current, causing sparking that can lead to a fire. (= MoneyBlogNewz)

Physics is the foundation of many important scientific disciplines. For example, chemistry deals with the interactions of atoms
and molecules. Not surprisingly, chemistry is rooted in atomic and molecular physics. Most branches of engineering are also
applied physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of determining structural stability, acoustics, heating, lighting, and
cooling for buildings. Parts of geology, the study of nonliving parts of Earth, rely heavily on physics; including radioactive
dating, earthquake analysis, and heat transfer across Earth’s surface. Indeed, some disciplines, such as biophysics and
geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines.
Physics also describes the chemical processes that power the human body. Physics is involved in medical diagnostics, such as xrays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonic blood flow measurements (Figure 1.8). Medical therapy Physics also has
many applications in biology, the study of life. For example, physics describes how cells can protect themselves using their cell
walls and cell membranes (Figure 1.9). Medical therapy sometimes directly involves physics, such as in using X-rays to diagnose
health conditions. Physics can also explain what we perceive with our senses, such as how the ears detect sound or the eye
detects color.

diseased regions. (Rashmi Chawla, Daniel Smith, and Paul E. Marik)

BOUNDLESS PHYSICS
The Physics of Landing on a Comet

On November 12, 2014, the European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft (shown in Figure 1.10) became the first ever to reach and
orbit a comet. Shortly after, Rosetta’s rover, Philae, landed on the comet, representing the first time humans have ever landed a
space probe on a comet.

Chapter 1 • What is Physics?

Figure 1.10 The Rosetta spacecraft, with its large and revolutionary solar panels, carried the Philae lander to a comet. The lander then
detached and landed on the comet’s surface. (European Space Agency)

After traveling 6.4 billion kilometers starting from its launch on Earth, Rosetta landed on the comet 67P/ChuryumovGerasimenko, which is only 4 kilometers wide. Physics was needed to successfully plot the course to reach such a small, distant,
and rapidly moving target. Rosetta’s path to the comet was not straight forward. The probe first had to travel to Mars so that
Mars’s gravity could accelerate it and divert it in the exact direction of the comet.
This was not the first time humans used gravity to power our spaceships. Voyager 2, a space probe launched in 1977, used the
gravity of Saturn to slingshot over to Uranus and Neptune (illustrated in Figure 1.11), providing the first pictures ever taken of
these planets. Now, almost 40 years after its launch, Voyager 2 is at the very edge of our solar system and is about to enter
interstellar space. Its sister ship, Voyager 1 (illustrated in Figure 1.11), which was also launched in 1977, is already there.
To listen to the sounds of interstellar space or see images that have been transmitted back from the Voyager I or to learn more
about the Voyager mission, visit the Voyager’s Mission website (https://openstax.org/l/28voyager) .

Voyager 1, the first space probe to ever leave our solar system and enter interstellar space. NASA

Both Voyagers have electrical power generators based on the decay of radioisotopes. These generators have served them for
almost 40 years. Rosetta, on the other hand, is solar-powered. In fact, Rosetta became the first space probe to travel beyond the
asteroid belt by relying only on solar cells for power generation.
At 800 million kilometers from the sun, Rosetta receives sunlight that is only 4 percent as strong as on Earth. In addition, it is
very cold in space. Therefore, a lot of physics went into developing Rosetta’s low-intensity low-temperature solar cells.
In this sense, the Rosetta project nicely shows the huge range of topics encompassed by physics: from modeling the movement
of gigantic planets over huge distances within our solar systems, to learning how to generate electric power from low-intensity
light. Physics is, by far, the broadest field of science.

In summary, physics studies many of the most basic aspects of science. A knowledge of physics is, therefore, necessary to
understand all other sciences. This is because physics explains the most basic ways in which our universe works. However, it is
not necessary to formally study all applications of physics. A knowledge of the basic laws of physics will be most useful to you, so
that you can use them to solve some everyday problems. In this way, the study of physics can improve your problem-solving
skills.

Scientific Methods
Scientists often plan and carry out investigations to answer questions about the universe around us. Such laws are intrinsic to
the universe, meaning that humans did not create them and cannot change them. We can only discover and understand them.
Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements of mystery, imagination, struggle, triumph, and disappointment
inherent in any creative effort. The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is observation. Science must describe the universe as
it is, not as we imagine or wish it to be.
We all are curious to some extent. We look around, make generalizations, and try to understand what we see. For example, we
look up and wonder whether one type of cloud signals an oncoming storm. As we become serious about exploring nature, we
become more organized and formal in collecting and analyzing data. We attempt greater precision, perform controlled
experiments (if we can), and write down ideas about how data may be organized. We then formulate models, theories, and laws
based on the data we have collected, and communicate those results with others. This, in a nutshell, describes the scientific
method that scientists employ to decide scientific issues on the basis of evidence from observation and experiment.
An investigation often begins with a scientist making an observation. The scientist observes a pattern or trend within the
natural world. Observation may generate questions that the scientist wishes to answer. Next, the scientist may perform some
research about the topic and devise a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a testable statement that describes how something in the
natural world works. In essence, a hypothesis is an educated guess that explains something about an observation.
Scientists may test the hypothesis by performing an experiment. During an experiment, the scientist collects data that will help
them learn about the phenomenon they are studying. Then the scientists analyze the results of the experiment (that is, the data),
often using statistical, mathematical, and/or graphical methods. From the data analysis, they draw conclusions. They may
conclude that their experiment either supports or rejects their hypothesis. If the hypothesis is supported, the scientist usually
goes on to test another hypothesis related to the first. If their hypothesis is rejected, they will often then test a new and different
hypothesis in their effort to learn more about whatever they are studying.
Scientific processes can be applied to many situations. Let’s say that you try to turn on your car, but it will not start. You have
just made an observation! You ask yourself, "Why won’t my car start?" You can now use scientific processes to answer this
question. First, you generate a hypothesis such as, "The car won’t start because it has no gasoline in the gas tank." To test this
hypothesis, you put gasoline in the car and try to start it again. If the car starts, then your hypothesis is supported by the
experiment. If the car does not start, then your hypothesis is rejected. You will then need to think up a new hypothesis to test
such as, "My car won’t start because the fuel pump is broken." Hopefully, your investigations lead you to discover why the car
won’t start and enable you to fix it.

Modeling
A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to study directly. Models can take the form of
physical models, equations, computer programs, or simulations—computer graphics/animations. Models are tools that are
especially useful in modern physics because they let us visualize phenomena that we normally cannot observe with our senses,
such as very small objects or objects that move at high speeds. For example, we can understand the structure of an atom using
models, despite the fact that no one has ever seen an atom with their own eyes. Models are always approximate, so they are
simpler to consider than the real situation; the more complete a model is, the more complicated it must be. Models put the

1.2 • The Scientific Methods

intangible or the extremely complex into human terms that we can visualize, discuss, and hypothesize about.
Scientific models are constructed based on the results of previous experiments. Even still, models often only describe a
phenomenon partially or in a few limited situations. Some phenomena are so complex that they may be impossible to model
them in their entirety, even using computers. An example is the electron cloud model of the atom in which electrons are moving
around the atom’s center in distinct clouds (Figure 1.12), that represent the likelihood of finding an electron in different places.
This model helps us to visualize the structure of an atom. However, it does not show us exactly where an electron will be within
its cloud at any one particular time.

Figure 1.12 The electron cloud model of the atom predicts the geometry and shape of areas where different electrons may be found in an
atom. However, it cannot indicate exactly where an electron will be at any one time.

As mentioned previously, physicists use a variety of models including equations, physical models, computer simulations, etc.
For example, three-dimensional models are often commonly used in chemistry and physics to model molecules. Properties
other than appearance or location are usually modelled using mathematics, where functions are used to show how these
properties relate to one another. Processes such as the formation of a star or the planets, can also be modelled using computer
simulations. Once a simulation is correctly programmed based on actual experimental data, the simulation can allow us to view
processes that happened in the past or happen too quickly or slowly for us to observe directly. In addition, scientists can also run
virtual experiments using computer-based models. In a model of planet formation, for example, the scientist could alter the
amount or type of rocks present in space and see how it affects planet formation.
Scientists use models and experimental results to construct explanations of observations or design solutions to problems. For
example, one way to make a car more fuel efficient is to reduce the friction or drag caused by air flowing around the moving car.
This can be done by designing the body shape of the car to be more aerodynamic, such as by using rounded corners instead of
sharp ones. Engineers can then construct physical models of the car body, place them in a wind tunnel, and examine the flow of
air around the model. This can also be done mathematically in a computer simulation. The air flow pattern can be analyzed for
regions smooth air flow and for eddies that indicate drag. The model of the car body may have to be altered slightly to produce
the smoothest pattern of air flow (i.e., the least drag). The pattern with the least drag may be the solution to increasing fuel
efficiency of the car. This solution might then be incorporated into the car design.

exposed to the airflow. Then, for each location, predict which way the paper will move if your air flow diagram is
correct.

Scientific Laws and Theories
A scientific law is a description of a pattern in nature that is true in all circumstances that have been studied. That is, physical
laws are meant to be universal, meaning that they apply throughout the known universe. Laws are often also concise, whereas
theories are more complicated. A law can be expressed in the form of a single sentence or mathematical equation. For example,
Newton’s second law of motion, which relates the motion of an object to the force applied (F), the mass of the object (m), and the
object’s acceleration (a), is simply stated using the equation
Scientific ideas and explanations that are true in many, but not all situations in the universe are usually called principles. An
example is Pascal’s principle, which explains properties of liquids, but not solids or gases. However, the distinction between laws
and principles is sometimes not carefully made in science.
A theory is an explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by much scientific evidence and verified multiple times by
multiple researchers. While many people confuse theories with educated guesses or hypotheses, theories have withstood more
rigorous testing and verification than hypotheses.
As a closing idea about scientific processes, we want to point out that scientific laws and theories, even those that have been
supported by experiments for centuries, can still be changed by new discoveries. This is especially true when new technologies
emerge that allow us to observe things that were formerly unobservable. Imagine how viewing previously invisible objects with a

microscope or viewing Earth for the first time from space may have instantly changed our scientific theories and laws! What
discoveries still await us in the future? The constant retesting and perfecting of our scientific laws and theories allows our
knowledge of nature to progress. For this reason, many scientists are reluctant to say that their studies prove anything. By
saying support instead of prove, it keeps the door open for future discoveries, even if they won’t occur for centuries or even
millennia.

The Role of Units
Physicists, like other scientists, make observations and ask basic questions. For example, how big is an object? How much mass
does it have? How far did it travel? To answer these questions, they make measurements with various instruments (e.g., meter
stick, balance, stopwatch, etc.).
The measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of units, which are standardized values. For example, the length
of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for long distance runners).
Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a
meaningful way (Figure 1.13).

Figure 1.13 Distances given in unknown units are maddeningly useless.

All physical quantities in the International System of Units (SI) are expressed in terms of combinations of seven fundamental

physical units, which are units for: length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, amount of a substance, and luminous
intensity.

SI Units: Fundamental and Derived Units
There are two major systems of units used in the world: SI units (acronym for the French Le Système International d’Unités, also
known as the metric system), and English units (also known as the imperial system). English units were historically used in
nations once ruled by the British Empire. Today, the United States is the only country that still uses English units extensively.
Virtually every other country in the world now uses the metric system, which is the standard system agreed upon by scientists
and mathematicians.
Some physical quantities are more fundamental than others. In physics, there are seven fundamental physical quantities that
are measured in base or physical fundamental units: length, mass, time, electric current temperature, amount of substance, and
luminous intensity. Units for other physical quantities (such as force, speed, and electric charge) described by mathematically
combining these seven base units. In this course, we will mainly use five of these: length, mass, time, electric current and
temperature. The units in which they are measured are the meter, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela (Table
1.1). All other units are made by mathematically combining the fundamental units. These are called derived units.

Table 1.1 SI Base Units

The Meter
The SI unit for length is the meter (m). The definition of the meter has changed over time to become more accurate and precise.
The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was
improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum-iridium bar. (The bar is
now housed at the International Bureau of Weights and Meaures, near Paris). By 1960, some distances could be measured more
precisely by comparing them to wavelengths of light. The meter was redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light
emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its present definition as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/
299,792,458 of a second (Figure 1.14).

Figure 1.14 The meter is defined to be the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second through a vacuum. Distance traveled is
speed multiplied by time.

Chapter 1 • What is Physics?

The Kilogram
The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg). It is defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder, housed at the International
Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact replicas of the standard kilogram cylinder are kept in numerous locations
throughout the world, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The
determination of all other masses can be done by comparing them with one of these standard kilograms.

The Second
The SI unit for time, the second (s) also has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of an average solar day.
However, the average solar day is actually very gradually getting longer due to gradual slowing of Earth’s rotation. Accuracy in
the fundamental units is essential, since all other measurements are derived from them. Therefore, a new standard was adopted
to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon. One constant phenomenon is the very steady
vibration of Cesium atoms, which can be observed and counted. This vibration forms the basis of the cesium atomic clock. In
1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 Cesium atom vibrations (Figure 1.15).

Figure 1.15 An atomic clock such as this one uses the vibrations of cesium atoms to keep time to a precision of one microsecond per year.
The fundamental unit of time, the second, is based on such clocks. This image is looking down from the top of an atomic clock. (Steve
Jurvetson/Flickr)

The Ampere

Electric current is measured in the ampere (A), named after Andre Ampere. You have probably heard of amperes, or amps, when
people discuss electrical currents or electrical devices. Understanding an ampere requires a basic understanding of electricity
and magnetism, something that will be explored in depth in later chapters of this book. Basically, two parallel wires with an
electric current running through them will produce an attractive force on each other. One ampere is defined as the amount of
electric current that will produce an attractive force of 2.7 10–7 newton per meter of separation between the two wires (the
newton is the derived unit of force).

Kelvins
The SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (or kelvins, but not degrees kelvin). This scale is named after physicist William Thomson,
Lord Kelvin, who was the first to call for an absolute temperature scale. The Kelvin scale is based on absolute zero. This is the
point at which all thermal energy has been removed from all atoms or molecules in a system. This temperature, 0 K, is equal to
−273.15 °C and −459.67 °F. Conveniently, the Kelvin scale actually changes in the same way as the Celsius scale. For example, the
freezing point (0 °C) and boiling points of water (100 °C) are 100 degrees apart on the Celsius scale. These two temperatures are
also 100 kelvins apart (freezing point = 273.15 K; boiling point = 373.15 K).

Metric Prefixes
Physical objects or phenomena may vary widely. For example, the size of objects varies from something very small (like an atom)

1.3 • The Language of Physics: Physical Quantities and Units

to something very large (like a star). Yet the standard metric unit of length is the meter. So, the metric system includes many
prefixes that can be attached to a unit. Each prefix is based on factors of 10 (10, 100, 1,000, etc., as well as 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, etc.).
Table 1.2 gives the metric prefixes and symbols used to denote the different various factors of 10 in the metric system.

Example Description

Table 1.2 Metric Prefixes for Powers of 10 and Their Symbols [1]See Appendix A for a discussion of powers of 10.
Note—Some examples are approximate.
The metric system is convenient because conversions between metric units can be done simply by moving the decimal place of a
number. This is because the metric prefixes are sequential powers of 10. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, 1000 meters in a
kilometer, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as U.S. customary units, the relationships are less simple—there are 12 inches
in a foot, 5,280 feet in a mile, 4 quarts in a gallon, and so on. Another advantage of the metric system is that the same unit can be
used over extremely large ranges of values simply by switching to the most-appropriate metric prefix. For example, distances in
meters are suitable for building construction, but kilometers are used to describe road construction. Therefore, with the metric
system, there is no need to invent new units when measuring very small or very large objects—you just have to move the decimal

point (and use the appropriate prefix).

Known Ranges of Length, Mass, and Time
Table 1.3 lists known lengths, masses, and time measurements. You can see that scientists use a range of measurement units.
This wide range demonstrates the vastness and complexity of the universe, as well as the breadth of phenomena physicists
study. As you examine this table, note how the metric system allows us to discuss and compare an enormous range of
phenomena, using one system of measurement (Figure 1.16 and Figure 1.17).

Using Scientific Notation with Physical Measurements
Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too large or small to be conveniently written as a decimal. For example,
consider the number 840,000,000,000,000. It’s a rather large number to write out. The scientific notation for this number is
8.40 1014. Scientific notation follows this general format
In this format x is the value of the measurement with all placeholder zeros removed. In the example above, x is 8.4. The x is
multiplied by a factor, 10y, which indicates the number of placeholder zeros in the measurement. Placeholder zeros are those at
the end of a number that is 10 or greater, and at the beginning of a decimal number that is less than 1. In the example above, the
factor is 1014. This tells you that you should move the decimal point 14 positions to the right, filling in placeholder zeros as you
go. In this case, moving the decimal point 14 places creates only 13 placeholder zeros, indicating that the actual measurement
value is 840,000,000,000,000.

23

24

Chapter 1 • What is Physics?

Numbers that are fractions can be indicated by scientific notation as well. Consider the number 0.0000045. Its scientific
notation is 4.5 10–6. Its scientific notation has the same format
Here, x is 4.5. However, the value of y in the 10y factor is negative, which indicates that the measurement is a fraction of 1.
Therefore, we move the decimal place to the left, for a negative y. In our example of 4.5 10–6, the decimal point would be
moved to the left six times to yield the original number, which would be 0.0000045.
The term order of magnitude refers to the power of 10 when numbers are expressed in scientific notation. Quantities that have
the same power of 10 when expressed in scientific notation, or come close to it, are said to be of the same order of magnitude.
For example, the number 800 can be written as 8 102, and the number 450 can be written as 4.5 102. Both numbers have the
same value for y. Therefore, 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude. Similarly, 101 and 99 would be regarded as the
same order of magnitude, 102. Order of magnitude can be thought of as a ballpark estimate for the scale of a value. The diameter
of an atom is on the order of 10−9 m, while the diameter of the sun is on the order of 109 m. These two values are 18 orders of
magnitude apart.
Scientists make frequent use of scientific notation because of the vast range of physical measurements possible in the universe,
such as the distance from Earth to the moon (Figure 1.18), or to the nearest star.

Figure 1.18 The distance from Earth to the moon may seem immense, but it is just a tiny fraction of the distance from Earth to our closest
neighboring star. (NASA)

Unit Conversion and Dimensional Analysis
It is often necessary to convert from one type of unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook in the
United States, some quantities may be expressed in liters and you need to convert them to cups. A Canadian tourist driving
through the United States might want to convert miles to kilometers, to have a sense of how far away his next destination is. A
doctor in the United States might convert a patient’s weight in pounds to kilograms.
Let’s consider a simple example of how to convert units within the metric system. How can we want to convert 1 hour to seconds?
Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio expressing how
many of one unit are equal to another unit. A conversion factor is simply a fraction which equals 1. You can multiply any number
by 1 and get the same value. When you multiply a number by a conversion factor, you are simply multiplying it by one. For
example, the following are conversion factors: (1 foot)/(12 inches) = 1 to convert inches to feet, (1 meter)/(100 centimeters) = 1 to
convert centimeters to meters, (1 minute)/(60 seconds) = 1 to convert seconds to minutes. In this case, we know that there are
1,000 meters in 1 kilometer.
Now we can set up our unit conversion. We will write the units that we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor (1
km/1,000m) = 1, so we are simply multiplying 80m by 1:
1.1
When there is a unit in the original number, and a unit in the denominator (bottom) of the conversion factor, the units cancel. In
this case, hours and minutes cancel and the value in seconds remains.
You can use this method to convert between any types of unit, including between the U.S. customary system and metric system.
Notice also that, although you can multiply and divide units algebraically, you cannot add or subtract different units. An
expression like 10 km + 5 kg makes no sense. Even adding two lengths in different units, such as 10 km + 20 m does not make
sense. You express both lengths in the same unit. See Appendix C for a more complete list of conversion factors.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Unit Conversions: A Short Drive Home

Suppose that you drive the 10.0 km from your university to home in 20.0 min. Calculate your average speed (a) in kilometers per
hour (km/h) and (b) in meters per second (m/s). (Note—Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.)
Strategy
First we calculate the average speed using the given units. Then we can get the average speed into the desired units by picking
the correct conversion factor and multiplying by it. The correct conversion factor is the one that cancels the unwanted unit and
leaves the desired unit in its place.
Solution for (a)
1. Calculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel. (Take this definition as a given for
now—average speed and other motion concepts will be covered in a later module.) In equation form,

2. Substitute the given values for distance and time.

3. Convert km/min to km/h: multiply by the conversion factor that will cancel minutes and leave hours. That conversion factor
. Thus,
is

Discussion for (a)
To check your answer, consider the following:
1. Be sure that you have properly cancelled the units in the unit conversion. If you have written the unit conversion factor
upside down, the units will not cancel properly in the equation. If you accidentally get the ratio upside down, then the units
will not cancel; rather, they will give you the wrong units as follows

which are obviously not the desired units of km/h.
2. Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked us to solve for average speed in units of
km/h and we have indeed obtained these units.
3. Check the significant figures. Because each of the values given in the problem has three significant figures, the answer
should also have three significant figures. The answer 30.0 km/h does indeed have three significant figures, so this is
appropriate. Note that the significant figures in the conversion factor are not relevant because an hour is defined to be 60
min, so the precision of the conversion factor is perfect.
4. Next, check whether the answer is reasonable. Let us consider some information from the problem—if you travel 10 km in a
third of an hour (20 min), you would travel three times that far in an hour. The answer does seem reasonable.
Solution (b)
There are several ways to convert the average speed into meters per second.
1. Start with the answer to (a) and convert km/h to m/s. Two conversion factors are needed—one to convert hours to seconds,
and another to convert kilometers to meters.
2. Multiplying by these yields

25

26

Chapter 1 • What is Physics?

Discussion for (b)
If we had started with 0.500 km/min, we would have needed different conversion factors, but the answer would have been the
same: 8.33 m/s.
You may have noted that the answers in the worked example just covered were given to three digits. Why? When do you need to
be concerned about the number of digits in something you calculate? Why not write down all the digits your calculator
produces?

WORKED EXAMPLE
Using Physics to Evaluate Promotional Materials

A commemorative coin that is 2″ in diameter is advertised to be plated with 15 mg of gold. If the density of gold is 19.3 g/cc, and
the amount of gold around the edge of the coin can be ignored, what is the thickness of the gold on the top and bottom faces of
the coin?
Strategy
To solve this problem, the volume of the gold needs to be determined using the gold’s mass and density. Half of that volume is
distributed on each face of the coin, and, for each face, the gold can be represented as a cylinder that is 2″ in diameter with a
height equal to the thickness. Use the volume formula for a cylinder to determine the thickness.
Solution
The mass of the gold is given by the formula

where

and V is the volume. Solving for

the volume gives
If t is the thickness, the volume corresponding to half the gold is

where the 1″ radius

has been converted to cm. Solving for the thickness gives
Discussion
The amount of gold used is stated to be 15 mg, which is equivalent to a thickness of about 0.00019 mm. The mass figure may
make the amount of gold sound larger, both because the number is much bigger (15 versus 0.00019), and because people may
have a more intuitive feel for how much a millimeter is than for how much a milligram is. A simple analysis of this sort can
clarify the significance of claims made by advertisers.

Accuracy, Precision and Significant Figures
Science is based on experimentation that requires good measurements. The validity of a measurement can be described in terms
of its accuracy and its precision (see Figure 1.19 and Figure 1.20). Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the correct value for
that measurement. For example, let us say that you are measuring the length of standard piece of printer paper. The packaging
in which you purchased the paper states that it is 11 inches long, and suppose this stated value is correct. You measure the length
of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 inches, 11.2 inches, and 10.9 inches. These measurements
are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0 inches. In contrast, if you had obtained a measurement
of 12 inches, your measurement would not be very accurate. This is why measuring instruments are calibrated based on a known
measurement. If the instrument consistently returns the correct value of the known measurement, it is safe for use in finding
unknown values.

1.3 • The Language of Physics: Physical Quantities and Units

Figure 1.19 A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass is placed in one
pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is horizontal, then the masses in both
pans are equal. The known masses are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1 gram, 10 grams, and 100 grams. (Serge Melki)

Figure 1.20 Whereas a mechanical balance may only read the mass of an object to the nearest tenth of a gram, some digital scales can
measure the mass of an object up to the nearest thousandth of a gram. As in other measuring devices, the precision of a scale is limited to
the last measured figures. This is the hundredths place in the scale pictured here. (Splarka, Wikimedia Commons)

Precision states how well repeated measurements of something generate the same or similar results. Therefore, the precision of
measurements refers to how close together the measurements are when you measure the same thing several times. One way to
analyze the precision of measurements would be to determine the range, or difference between the lowest and the highest
measured values. In the case of the printer paper measurements, the lowest value was 10.9 inches and the highest value was 11.2
inches. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 inches. These measurements were reasonably
precise because they varied by only a fraction of an inch. However, if the measured values had been 10.9 inches, 11.1 inches, and
11.9 inches, then the measurements would not be very precise because there is a lot of variation from one measurement to
another.
The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but not
precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let us consider a GPS system that is attempting to locate the position of a
restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull’s-eye target. Then think of each GPS
attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot on the bull’s eye.
In Figure 1.21, you can see that the GPS measurements are spread far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the
actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low precision, high accuracy measuring system.
However, in Figure 1.22, the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the
target location. This indicates a high precision, low accuracy measuring system. Finally, in Figure 1.23, the GPS is both precise
and accurate, allowing the restaurant to be located.

Uncertainty
The accuracy and precision of a measuring system determine the uncertainty of its measurements. Uncertainty is a way to
describe how much your measured value deviates from the actual value that the object has. If your measurements are not very
accurate or precise, then the uncertainty of your values will be very high. In more general terms, uncertainty can be thought of
as a disclaimer for your measured values. For example, if someone asked you to provide the mileage on your car, you might say
that it is 45,000 miles, plus or minus 500 miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your value. That is, you are
indicating that the actual mileage of your car might be as low as 44,500 miles or as high as 45,500 miles, or anywhere in
between. All measurements contain some amount of uncertainty. In our example of measuring the length of the paper, we
might say that the length of the paper is 11 inches plus or minus 0.2 inches or 11.0 ± 0.2 inches. The uncertainty in a

The factors contributing to uncertainty in a measurement include the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Limitations of the measuring device
The skill of the person making the measurement
Irregularities in the object being measured
Any other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation)

In the printer paper example uncertainty could be caused by: the fact that the smallest division on the ruler is 0.1 inches, the
person using the ruler has bad eyesight, or uncertainty caused by the paper cutting machine (e.g., one side of the paper is
slightly longer than the other.) It is good practice to carefully consider all possible sources of uncertainty in a measurement and
reduce or eliminate them,

Percent Uncertainty

One method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured value. If a measurement, A, is expressed with uncertainty,
δA, the percent uncertainty is

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating Percent Uncertainty: A Bag of Apples

A grocery store sells 5-lb bags of apples. You purchase four bags over the course of a month and weigh the apples each time. You
obtain the following measurements:
• Week 1 weight:
• Week 2 weight:
• Week 3 weight:
• Week 4 weight:
You determine that the weight of the 5 lb bag has an uncertainty of ±0.4 lb. What is the percent uncertainty of the bag’s weight?
Strategy
First, observe that the expected value of the bag’s weight, , is 5 lb. The uncertainty in this value, , is 0.4 lb. We can use the
following equation to determine the percent uncertainty of the weight

Solution
Plug the known values into the equation

Discussion
We can conclude that the weight of the apple bag is 5 lb ± 8 percent. Consider how this percent uncertainty would change if the
bag of apples were half as heavy, but the uncertainty in the weight remained the same. Hint for future calculations: when
calculating percent uncertainty, always remember that you must multiply the fraction by 100 percent. If you do not do this, you
will have a decimal quantity, not a percent value.

Uncertainty in Calculations
There is an uncertainty in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from
measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the both the length and width have uncertainties. How big is
the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements in the calculation have small
uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the method of adding percents can be used. This method says that the percent
uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to
make the calculation. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m, with uncertainties of 2 percent and 1

29

30

Chapter 1 • What is Physics?

percent, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0 m2 and has an uncertainty of 3 percent (expressed as an area this is 0.36
m2, which we round to 0.4 m2 since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter).
For a quick demonstration of the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty of measurements based upon the units of measurement,
try this simulation (http://openstax.org/l/28precision) . You will have the opportunity to measure the length and weight of a
desk, using milli- versus centi- units. Which do you think will provide greater accuracy, precision and uncertainty when
measuring the desk and the notepad in the simulation? Consider how the nature of the hypothesis or research question might
influence how precise of a measuring tool you need to collect data.

Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures
An important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements is the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise
measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, consider measuring the thickness of a
coin. A standard ruler can measure thickness to the nearest millimeter, while a micrometer can measure the thickness to the
nearest 0.005 millimeter. The micrometer is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences
in thickness. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be.
When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we initially measured with our measuring tool (such as the
rulers shown in Figure 1.24). For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, you may measure it with a
decimeter ruler as 3.6 cm. You could not express this value as 3.65 cm because your measuring tool was not precise enough to
measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way
by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices that
the stick length seems to be somewhere in between 36 mm and 37 mm. He or she must estimate the value of the last digit. The
rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. For example, the last measured
value 36.5 mm has three digits, or three significant figures. The number of significant figures in a measurement indicates the
precision of the measuring tool. The more precise a measuring tool is, the greater the number of significant figures it can
report.

Figure 1.24 Three metric rulers are shown. The first ruler is in decimeters and can measure point three decimeters. The second ruler is in
centimeters long and can measure three point six centimeters. The last ruler is in millimeters and can measure thirty-six point five
millimeters.

Zeros
Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. For example, the zeros in 0.053 are not significant
because they are only placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053—the 5 and the 3.
However, if the zero occurs between other significant figures, the zeros are significant. For example, both zeros in 10.053 are
significant, as these zeros were actually measured. Therefore, the 10.053 placeholder has five significant figures. The zeros in
1300 may or may not be significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the
last zero, or the zeros could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity,

1.3 • The Language of Physics: Physical Quantities and Units

write 1300 in scientific notation as 1.3 × 103. Only significant figures are given in the x factor for a number in scientific notation
(in the form
). Therefore, we know that 1 and 3 are the only significant digits in this number. In summary, zeros are
significant except when they serve only as placeholders. Table 1.4 provides examples of the number of significant figures in
various numbers.

Significant Figures in Calculations
When combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and precision, the number of significant digits in the final
answer can be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least precise measured value. There are two different rules,
one for multiplication and division and another rule for addition and subtraction, as discussed below.
1. For multiplication and division: The answer should have the same number of significant figures as the starting value with
. Let us see
the fewest significant figures. For example, the area of a circle can be calculated from its radius using
how many significant figures the area will have if the radius has only two significant figures, for example, r = 2.0 m. Then,
using a calculator that keeps eight significant figures, you would get

But because the radius has only two significant figures, the area calculated is meaningful only to two significant figures or

even though the value of

is meaningful to at least eight digits.

2. For addition and subtraction: The answer should have the same number places (e.g. tens place, ones place, tenths place,
etc.) as the least-precise starting value. Suppose that you buy 7.56 kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale
having a precision of 0.01 kg. Then you drop off 6.052 kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with a
precision of 0.001 kg. Finally, you go home and add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with a precision of
0.1 kg. How many kilograms of potatoes do you now have, and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer?
The mass is found by simple addition and subtraction:

31

32

Chapter 1 • What is Physics?

The least precise measurement is 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place, so our final answer must
also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer should be rounded to the tenths place, giving 15.2 kg. The same
is true for non-decimal numbers. For example,
We cannot report the decimal places in the answer because 2 has no decimal places that would be significant. Therefore, we
can only report to the ones place.
It is a good idea to keep extra significant figures while calculating, and to round off to the correct number of significant
figures only in the final answers. The reason is that small errors from rounding while calculating can sometimes produce
significant errors in the final answer. As an example, try calculating
to obtain a final answer
to only two significant figures. Keeping all significant during the calculation gives 48. Rounding to two significant figures
in the middle of the calculation changes it to
which is way off. You would similarly
avoid rounding in the middle of the calculation in counting and in doing accounting, where many small numbers need to
be added and subtracted accurately to give possibly much larger final numbers.

Significant Figures in this Text
In this textbook, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of significant
figures are used in all worked examples. You will note that an answer given to three digits is based on input good to at least three
digits. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures. Care is also taken that the
number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some topics, such as optics, more than three significant

Approximating Vast Numbers: a Trillion Dollars

The U.S. federal deficit in the 2008 fiscal year was a little greater than $10 trillion. Most of us do not have any concept of how
much even one trillion actually is. Suppose that you were given a trillion dollars in $100 bills. If you made 100-bill stacks, like
that shown in Figure 1.25, and used them to evenly cover a football field (between the end zones), make an approximation of how
high the money pile would become. (We will use feet/inches rather than meters here because football fields are measured in
yards.) One of your friends says 3 in., while another says 10 ft. What do you think?

A bank stack contains one hundred $100 bills, and is worth $10,000. How many bank stacks make up a trillion dollars?

Strategy
When you imagine the situation, you probably envision thousands of small stacks of 100 wrapped $100 bills, such as you might
see in movies or at a bank. Since this is an easy-to-approximate quantity, let us start there. We can find the volume of a stack of
100 bills, find out how many stacks make up one trillion dollars, and then set this volume equal to the area of the football field
multiplied by the unknown height.
Solution
1. Calculate the volume of a stack of 100 bills. The dimensions of a single bill are approximately 3 in. by 6 in. A stack of 100 of
these is about 0.5 in. thick. So the total volume of a stack of 100 bills is

The final approximate value is much higher than the early estimate of 3 in., but the other early estimate of 10 ft (120 in.) was
roughly correct. How did the approximation measure up to your first guess? What can this exercise tell you in terms of rough

Graphing in Physics
Most results in science are presented in scientific journal articles using graphs. Graphs present data in a way that is easy to
visualize for humans in general, especially someone unfamiliar with what is being studied. They are also useful for presenting
large amounts of data or data with complicated trends in an easily-readable way.
One commonly-used graph in physics and other sciences is the line graph, probably because it is the best graph for showing how
one quantity changes in response to the other. Let’s build a line graph based on the data in Table 1.5, which shows the measured
distance that a train travels from its station versus time. Our two variables, or things that change along the graph, are time in
minutes, and distance from the station, in kilometers. Remember that measured data may not have perfect accuracy.

1. Draw the two axes. The horizontal axis, or x-axis, shows the independent variable, which is the variable that is controlled
or manipulated. The vertical axis, or y-axis, shows the dependent variable, the non-manipulated variable that changes
with (or is dependent on) the value of the independent variable. In the data above, time is the independent variable and
should be plotted on the x-axis. Distance from the station is the dependent variable and should be plotted on the y-axis.

1.3 • The Language of Physics: Physical Quantities and Units

2. Label each axes on the graph with the name of each variable, followed by the symbol for its units in parentheses. Be sure to
leave room so that you can number each axis. In this example, use Time (min) as the label for the x-axis.
3. Next, you must determine the best scale to use for numbering each axis. Because the time values on the x-axis are taken
every 10 minutes, we could easily number the x-axis from 0 to 70 minutes with a tick mark every 10 minutes. Likewise, the
y-axis scale should start low enough and continue high enough to include all of the distance from station values. A scale
from 0 km to 160 km should suffice, perhaps with a tick mark every 10 km.
In general, you want to pick a scale for both axes that 1) shows all of your data, and 2) makes it easy to identify trends in
your data. If you make your scale too large, it will be harder to see how your data change. Likewise, the smaller and more
fine you make your scale, the more space you will need to make the graph. The number of significant figures in the axis
values should be coarser than the number of significant figures in the measurements.
4. Now that your axes are ready, you can begin plotting your data. For the first data point, count along the x-axis until you find
the 10 min tick mark. Then, count up from that point to the 10 km tick mark on the y-axis, and approximate where 22 km is
along the y-axis. Place a dot at this location. Repeat for the other six data points (Figure 1.26).

Figure 1.26 The graph of the train’s distance from the station versus time from the exercise above.

5. Add a title to the top of the graph to state what the graph is describing, such as the y-axis parameter vs. the x-axis
parameter. In the graph shown here, the title is train motion. It could also be titled distance of the train from the station vs.
time.
6. Finally, with data points now on the graph, you should draw a trend line (Figure 1.27). The trend line represents the
dependence you think the graph represents, so that the person who looks at your graph can see how close it is to the real
data. In the present case, since the data points look like they ought to fall on a straight line, you would draw a straight line
as the trend line. Draw it to come closest to all the points. Real data may have some inaccuracies, and the plotted points
may not all fall on the trend line. In some cases, none of the data points fall exactly on the trend line.

Chapter 1 • What is Physics?

Figure 1.27 The completed graph with the trend line included.

Analyzing a Graph Using Its Equation
One way to get a quick snapshot of a dataset is to look at the equation of its trend line. If the graph produces a straight line, the
equation of the trend line takes the form

The b in the equation is the y-intercept while the m in the equation is the slope. The y-intercept tells you at what y value the line
intersects the y-axis. In the case of the graph above, the y-intercept occurs at 0, at the very beginning of the graph. The
y-intercept, therefore, lets you know immediately where on the y-axis the plot line begins.
The m in the equation is the slope. This value describes how much the line on the graph moves up or down on the y-axis along
the line’s length. The slope is found using the following equation

In order to solve this equation, you need to pick two points on the line (preferably far apart on the line so the slope you calculate
describes the line accurately). The quantities Y2 and Y1 represent the y-values from the two points on the line (not data points)
that you picked, while X2 and X1 represent the two x-values of the those points.
What can the slope value tell you about the graph? The slope of a perfectly horizontal line will equal zero, while the slope of a
perfectly vertical line will be undefined because you cannot divide by zero. A positive slope indicates that the line moves up the
y-axis as the x-value increases while a negative slope means that the line moves down the y-axis. The more negative or positive
the slope is, the steeper the line moves up or down, respectively. The slope of our graph in Figure 1.26 is calculated below based
on the two endpoints of the line

Equation of line:
Because the x axis is time in minutes, we would actually be more likely to use the time t as the independent (x-axis) variable and
write the equation as

The formula
only applies to linear relationships, or ones that produce a straight line. Another common type of line
in physics is the quadratic relationship, which occurs when one of the variables is squared. One quadratic relationship in
physics is the relation between the speed of an object its centripetal acceleration, which is used to determine the force needed to
keep an object moving in a circle. Another common relationship in physics is the inverse relationship, in which one variable
decreases whenever the other variable increases. An example in physics is Coulomb’s law. As the distance between two charged
objects increases, the electrical force between the two charged objects decreases. Inverse proportionality, such the relation
between x and y in the equation

for some number k, is one particular kind of inverse relationship. A third commonly-seen relationship is the exponential
relationship, in which a change in the independent variable produces a proportional change in the dependent variable. As the
value of the dependent variable gets larger, its rate of growth also increases. For example, bacteria often reproduce at an
exponential rate when grown under ideal conditions. As each generation passes, there are more and more bacteria to reproduce.
As a result, the growth rate of the bacterial population increases every generation (Figure 1.28).

Figure 1.28 Examples of (a) linear, (b) quadratic, (c) inverse, and (d) exponential relationship graphs.

Using Logarithmic Scales in Graphing
Sometimes a variable can have a very large range of values. This presents a problem when you’re trying to figure out the best
scale to use for your graph’s axes. One option is to use a logarithmic (log) scale. In a logarithmic scale, the value each mark labels

37

38

Chapter 1 • What is Physics?

is the previous mark’s value multiplied by some constant. For a log base 10 scale, each mark labels a value that is 10 times the
value of the mark before it. Therefore, a base 10 logarithmic scale would be numbered: 0, 10, 100, 1,000, etc. You can see how the
logarithmic scale covers a much larger range of values than the corresponding linear scale, in which the marks would label the
values 0, 10, 20, 30, and so on.
If you use a logarithmic scale on one axis of the graph and a linear scale on the other axis, you are using a semi-log plot. The
Richter scale, which measures the strength of earthquakes, uses a semi-log plot. The degree of ground movement is plotted on a
logarithmic scale against the assigned intensity level of the earthquake, which ranges linearly from 1-10 (Figure 1.29 (a)).
If a graph has both axes in a logarithmic scale, then it is referred to as a log-log plot. The relationship between the wavelength
and frequency of electromagnetic radiation such as light is usually shown as a log-log plot (Figure 1.29 (b)). Log-log plots are also
commonly used to describe exponential functions, such as radioactive decay.

Figure 1.29 (a) The Richter scale uses a log base 10 scale on its y-axis (microns of amplified maximum ground motion). (b) The relationship
between the frequency and wavelength of electromagnetic radiation can be plotted as a straight line if a log-log plot is used.

measurements.
The four fundamental units we will use in this textbook
are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the
second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current).
These units are part of the metric system, which uses
powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges
encountered in nature.
Unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in
one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by
using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal
quantities of different units.
Accuracy of a measured value refers to how close a
measurement is to the correct value. The uncertainty in
a measurement is an estimate of the amount by which
the measurement result may differ from this value.
Precision of measured values refers to how close the
agreement is between repeated measurements.
Significant figures express the precision of a measuring
tool.
When multiplying or dividing measured values, the
final answer can contain only as many significant
figures as the least precise value.
When adding or subtracting measured values, the final
answer cannot contain more decimal places than the
least precise value.

Chapter Outline
2.1 Relative Motion, Distance, and Displacement
2.2 Speed and Velocity
2.3 Position vs. Time Graphs
2.4 Velocity vs. Time Graphs

INTRODUCTION Unless you have flown in an airplane, you have probably never traveled faster than 150 mph. Can you imagine
traveling in a train like the one shown in Figure 2.1 that goes over 300 mph? Despite the high speed, the people riding in this
train may not notice that they are moving at all unless they look out the window! This is because motion, even motion at 300
mph, is relative to the observer.
In this chapter, you will learn why it is important to identify a reference frame in order to clearly describe motion. For now, the
motion you describe will be one-dimensional. Within this context, you will learn the difference between distance and
displacement as well as the difference between speed and velocity. Then you will look at some graphing and problem-solving
techniques.

Defining Motion
Our study of physics opens with kinematics—the study of motion without considering its causes. Objects are in motion
everywhere you look. Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you
are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. Even in inanimate objects, atoms are always moving.
How do you know something is moving? The location of an object at any particular time is its position. More precisely, you need
to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe
the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be
described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole, while a professor’s position could be described
in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but
are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth,
as the reference frame. (See Figure 2.2.) Thus, you can only know how fast and in what direction an object's position is changing
against a background of something else that is either not moving or moving with a known speed and direction. The reference
frame is the coordinate system from which the positions of objects are described.

Figure 2.2 Are clouds a useful reference frame for airplane passengers? Why or why not? (Paul Brennan, Public Domain)

Your classroom can be used as a reference frame. In the classroom, the walls are not moving. Your motion as you walk to the
door, can be measured against the stationary background of the classroom walls. You can also tell if other things in the
classroom are moving, such as your classmates entering the classroom or a book falling off a desk. You can also tell in what
direction something is moving in the classroom. You might say, “The teacher is moving toward the door.” Your reference frame
allows you to determine not only that something is moving but also the direction of motion.
You could also serve as a reference frame for others’ movement. If you remained seated as your classmates left the room, you
would measure their movement away from your stationary location. If you and your classmates left the room together, then
your perspective of their motion would be change. You, as the reference frame, would be moving in the same direction as your
other moving classmates. As you will learn in the Snap Lab, your description of motion can be quite different when viewed from
different reference frames.

LINKS TO PHYSICS
History: Galileo's Ship

Figure 2.3 Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) studied motion and developed the concept of a reference frame. (Domenico Tintoretto)

The idea that a description of motion depends on the reference frame of the observer has been known for hundreds of years. The
17th-century astronomer Galileo Galilei (Figure 2.3) was one of the first scientists to explore this idea. Galileo suggested the
following thought experiment: Imagine a windowless ship moving at a constant speed and direction along a perfectly calm sea.
Is there a way that a person inside the ship can determine whether the ship is moving? You can extend this thought experiment

55

56

Chapter 2 • Motion in One Dimension

by also imagining a person standing on the shore. How can a person on the shore determine whether the ship is moving?
Galileo came to an amazing conclusion. Only by looking at each other can a person in the ship or a person on shore describe the
motion of one relative to the other. In addition, their descriptions of motion would be identical. A person inside the ship would
describe the person on the land as moving past the ship. The person on shore would describe the ship and the person inside it as
moving past. Galileo realized that observers moving at a constant speed and direction relative to each other describe motion in
the same way. Galileo had discovered that a description of motion is only meaningful if you specify a reference frame.
GRASP CHECK
Imagine standing on a platform watching a train pass by. According to Galileo’s conclusions, how would your description of
motion and the description of motion by a person riding on the train compare?
a. I would see the train as moving past me, and a person on the train would see me as stationary.
b. I would see the train as moving past me, and a person on the train would see me as moving past the train.
c. I would see the train as stationary, and a person on the train would see me as moving past the train.
d. I would see the train as stationary, and a person on the train would also see me as stationary.

Distance vs. Displacement
As we study the motion of objects, we must first be able to describe the object’s position. Before your parent drives you to school,
the car is sitting in your driveway. Your driveway is the starting position for the car. When you reach your high school, the car
has changed position. Its new position is your school.

Figure 2.4 Your total change in position is measured from your house to your school.

Physicists use variables to represent terms. We will use d to represent car’s position. We will use a subscript to differentiate
between the initial position, d0, and the final position, df. In addition, vectors, which we will discuss later, will be in bold or will
have an arrow above the variable. Scalars will be italicized.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

In some books, x or s is used instead of d to describe position. In d0, said d naught, the subscript 0 stands for initial. When
we begin to talk about two-dimensional motion, sometimes other subscripts will be used to describe horizontal position, dx,
or vertical position, dy. So, you might see references to d0x and dfy.
Now imagine driving from your house to a friend's house located several kilometers away. How far would you drive? The
distance an object moves is the length of the path between its initial position and its final position. The distance you drive to
your friend's house depends on your path. As shown in Figure 2.5, distance is different from the length of a straight line between
two points. The distance you drive to your friend's house is probably longer than the straight line between the two houses.

2.1 • Relative Motion, Distance, and Displacement

Figure 2.5 A short line separates the starting and ending points of this motion, but the distance along the path of motion is considerably
longer.

We often want to be more precise when we talk about position. The description of an object’s motion often includes more than
just the distance it moves. For instance, if it is a five kilometer drive to school, the distance traveled is 5 kilometers. After
dropping you off at school and driving back home, your parent will have traveled a total distance of 10 kilometers. The car and
your parent will end up in the same starting position in space. The net change in position of an object is its displacement, or
The Greek letter delta, , means change in.

Figure 2.6 The total distance that your car travels is 10 km, but the total displacement is 0.

3. When might you want to use one over the other?
a. Measurement of the total length of your path from the starting position to the final position gives the distance
traveled, and the measurement from your initial position to your final position is the displacement. Use distance to
describe the total path between starting and ending points,and use displacement to describe the shortest path
between starting and ending points.
b. Measurement of the total length of your path from the starting position to the final position is distance traveled,
and the measurement from your initial position to your final position is displacement. Use distance to describe the
shortest path between starting and ending points, and use displacement to describe the total path between starting
and ending points.
c. Measurement from your initial position to your final position is distance traveled, and the measurement of the total
length of your path from the starting position to the final position is displacement. Use distance to describe the
total path between starting and ending points, and use displacement to describe the shortest path between starting
and ending points.
d. Measurement from your initial position to your final position is distance traveled, and the measurement of the total
length of your path from the starting position to the final position is displacement. Use distance to describe the
shortest path between starting and ending points, and use displacement to describe the total path between starting
and ending points.

If you are describing only your drive to school, then the distance traveled and the displacement are the same—5 kilometers.
When you are describing the entire round trip, distance and displacement are different. When you describe distance, you only
include the magnitude, the size or amount, of the distance traveled. However, when you describe the displacement, you take
into account both the magnitude of the change in position and the direction of movement.
In our previous example, the car travels a total of 10 kilometers, but it drives five of those kilometers forward toward school and
five of those kilometers back in the opposite direction. If we ascribe the forward direction a positive (+) and the opposite
direction a negative (–), then the two quantities will cancel each other out when added together.
A quantity, such as distance, that has magnitude (i.e., how big or how much) but does not take into account direction is called a
scalar. A quantity, such as displacement, that has both magnitude and direction is called a vector.

Displacement Problems

Hopefully you now understand the conceptual difference between distance and displacement. Understanding concepts is half
the battle in physics. The other half is math. A stumbling block to new physics students is trying to wade through the math of
physics while also trying to understand the associated concepts. This struggle may lead to misconceptions and answers that
make no sense. Once the concept is mastered, the math is far less confusing.
So let’s review and see if we can make sense of displacement in terms of numbers and equations. You can calculate an object's
displacement by subtracting its original position, d0, from its final position df. In math terms that means
If the final position is the same as the initial position, then

.

To assign numbers and/or direction to these quantities, we need to define an axis with a positive and a negative direction. We
also need to define an origin, or O. In Figure 2.6, the axis is in a straight line with home at zero and school in the positive
direction. If we left home and drove the opposite way from school, motion would have been in the negative direction. We would
have assigned it a negative value. In the round-trip drive, df and d0 were both at zero kilometers. In the one way trip to school, df
was 5 kilometers.
was at 5 kilometers and d0 was at zero km. So,

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
You may place your origin wherever you would like. You have to make sure that you calculate all distances consistently from
your zero and you define one direction as positive and the other as negative. Therefore, it makes sense to choose the easiest
axis, direction, and zero. In the example above, we took home to be zero because it allowed us to avoid having to interpret a
solution with a negative sign.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating Distance and Displacement

A cyclist rides 3 km west and then turns around and rides 2 km east. (a) What is her displacement? (b) What distance does she
ride? (c) What is the magnitude of her displacement?

59

60

Chapter 2 • Motion in One Dimension

Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the final position and the initial position while taking care to note
the direction on the axis. The final position is the sum of the two displacements,
and
.
Solution
a. Displacement: The rider’s displacement is
b. Distance: The distance traveled is 3 km + 2 km = 5 km.
c. The magnitude of the displacement is 1 km.

.

Discussion
The displacement is negative because we chose east to be positive and west to be negative. We could also have described the
displacement as 1 km west. When calculating displacement, the direction mattered, but when calculating distance, the direction
did not matter. The problem would work the same way if the problem were in the north–south or y-direction.
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Physicists like to use standard units so it is easier to compare notes. The standard units for calculations are called SI units
(International System of Units). SI units are based on the metric system. The SI unit for displacement is the meter (m), but
sometimes you will see a problem with kilometers, miles, feet, or other units of length. If one unit in a problem is an SI unit
and another is not, you will need to convert all of your quantities to the same system before you can carry out the calculation.

Physicists make calculations all the time, but they do not always get the right answers. In 1998, NASA, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, launched the Mars Climate Orbiter, shown in Figure 2.7, a $125-million-dollar satellite designed to
monitor the Martian atmosphere. It was supposed to orbit the planet and take readings from a safe distance. The American
scientists made calculations in English units (feet, inches, pounds, etc.) and forgot to convert their answers to the standard
metric SI units. This was a very costly mistake. Instead of orbiting the planet as planned, the Mars Climate Orbiter ended up
flying into the Martian atmosphere. The probe disintegrated. It was one of the biggest embarrassments in NASA’s history.

3. What does it mean when motion is described as relative?
a. It means that motion of any object is described relative to the motion of Earth.
b. It means that motion of any object is described relative to the motion of any other object.
c. It means that motion is independent of the frame of reference.
d. It means that motion depends on the frame of reference selected.
4. If you and a friend are standing side-by-side watching a soccer game, would you both view the motion from the same
reference frame?
a. Yes, we would both view the motion from the same reference point because both of us are at rest in Earth’s frame of
reference.
b. Yes, we would both view the motion from the same reference point because both of us are observing the motion from
two points on the same straight line.
c. No, we would both view the motion from different reference points because motion is viewed from two different points;
the reference frames are similar but not the same.
d. No, we would both view the motion from different reference points because response times may be different; so, the
motion observed by both of us would be different.
5. What is the difference between distance and displacement?
a. Distance has both magnitude and direction, while displacement has magnitude but no direction.
b. Distance has magnitude but no direction, while displacement has both magnitude and direction.
c. Distance has magnitude but no direction, while displacement has only direction.
d. There is no difference. Both distance and displacement have magnitude and direction.
6. Which situation correctly identifies a race car’s distance traveled and the magnitude of displacement during a one-lap car
race?
a. The perimeter of the race track is the distance, and the shortest distance between the start line and the finish line is the
magnitude of displacement.
b. The perimeter of the race track is the magnitude of displacement, and the shortest distance between the start and finish
line is the distance.
c. The perimeter of the race track is both the distance and magnitude of displacement.
d. The shortest distance between the start line and the finish line is both the distance and magnitude of displacement.
7. Why is it important to specify a reference frame when describing motion?
a. Because Earth is continuously in motion; an object at rest on Earth will be in motion when viewed from outer space.
b. Because the position of a moving object can be defined only when there is a fixed reference frame.

There is more to motion than distance and displacement. Questions such as, “How long does a foot race take?” and “What was
the runner’s speed?” cannot be answered without an understanding of other concepts. In this section we will look at time, speed,
and velocity to expand our understanding of motion.
A description of how fast or slow an object moves is its speed. Speed is the rate at which an object changes its location. Like
distance, speed is a scalar because it has a magnitude but not a direction. Because speed is a rate, it depends on the time interval
of motion. You can calculate the elapsed time or the change in time, , of motion as the difference between the ending time
and the beginning time

The SI unit of time is the second (s), and the SI unit of speed is meters per second (m/s), but sometimes kilometers per hour
(km/h), miles per hour (mph) or other units of speed are used.
When you describe an object's speed, you often describe the average over a time period. Average speed, vavg, is the distance
traveled divided by the time during which the motion occurs.

You can, of course, rearrange the equation to solve for either distance or time

Suppose, for example, a car travels 150 kilometers in 3.2 hours. Its average speed for the trip is

A car's speed would likely increase and decrease many times over a 3.2 hour trip. Its speed at a specific instant in time, however,
is its instantaneous speed. A car's speedometer describes its instantaneous speed.

2.2 • Speed and Velocity

Figure 2.8 During a 30-minute round trip to the store, the total distance traveled is 6 km. The average speed is 12 km/h. The displacement
for the round trip is zero, because there was no net change in position.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating Average Speed

A marble rolls 5.2 m in 1.8 s. What was the marble's average speed?
Strategy
We know the distance the marble travels, 5.2 m, and the time interval, 1.8 s. We can use these values in the average speed
equation.
Solution

Discussion
Average speed is a scalar, so we do not include direction in the answer. We can check the reasonableness of the answer by
estimating: 5 meters divided by 2 seconds is 2.5 m/s. Since 2.5 m/s is close to 2.9 m/s, the answer is reasonable. This is about the
speed of a brisk walk, so it also makes sense.

Practice Problems
8. A pitcher throws a baseball from the pitcher’s mound to home plate in 0.46 s. The distance is 18.4 m. What was the average
speed of the baseball?
a. 40 m/s
b. - 40 m/s
c. 0.03 m/s
d. 8.5 m/s
9. Cassie walked to her friend’s house with an average speed of 1.40 m/s. The distance between the houses is 205 m. How long
did the trip take her?
a. 146 s
b. 0.01 s
c. 2.50 min
d. 287 s

Velocity
The vector version of speed is velocity. Velocity describes the speed and direction of an object. As with speed, it is useful to
describe either the average velocity over a time period or the velocity at a specific moment. Average velocity is displacement
divided by the time over which the displacement occurs.

63

64

Chapter 2 • Motion in One Dimension

Velocity, like speed, has SI units of meters per second (m/s), but because it is a vector, you must also include a direction.
Furthermore, the variable v for velocity is bold because it is a vector, which is in contrast to the variable v for speed which is
italicized because it is a scalar quantity.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
It is important to keep in mind that the average speed is not the same thing as the average velocity without its direction. Like
we saw with displacement and distance in the last section, changes in direction over a time interval have a bigger effect on
speed and velocity.
Suppose a passenger moved toward the back of a plane with an average velocity of –4 m/s. We cannot tell from the average
velocity whether the passenger stopped momentarily or backed up before he got to the back of the plane. To get more details, we
must consider smaller segments of the trip over smaller time intervals such as those shown in Figure 2.9. If you consider
infinitesimally small intervals, you can define instantaneous velocity, which is the velocity at a specific instant in time.
Instantaneous velocity and average velocity are the same if the velocity is constant.

Figure 2.9 The diagram shows a more detailed record of an airplane passenger heading toward the back of the plane, showing smaller
segments of his trip.

Earlier, you have read that distance traveled can be different than the magnitude of displacement. In the same way, speed can be
different than the magnitude of velocity. For example, you drive to a store and return home in half an hour. If your car’s
odometer shows the total distance traveled was 6 km, then your average speed was 12 km/h. Your average velocity, however, was
zero because your displacement for the round trip is zero.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating Average Velocity

A student has a displacement of 304 m north in 180 s. What was the student's average velocity?
Strategy
We know that the displacement is 304 m north and the time is 180 s. We can use the formula for average velocity to solve the
problem.
Solution
2.1
Discussion
Since average velocity is a vector quantity, you must include direction as well as magnitude in the answer. Notice, however, that
the direction can be omitted until the end to avoid cluttering the problem. Pay attention to the significant figures in the
problem. The distance 304 m has three significant figures, but the time interval 180 s has only two, so the quotient should have
only two significant figures.
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Note the way scalars and vectors are represented. In this book d represents distance and displacement. Similarly, v
represents speed, and v represents velocity. A variable that is not bold indicates a scalar quantity, and a bold variable
indicates a vector quantity. Vectors are sometimes represented by small arrows above the variable.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Solving for Displacement when Average Velocity and Time are Known

Layla jogs with an average velocity of 2.4 m/s east. What is her displacement after 46 seconds?
Strategy
We know that Layla's average velocity is 2.4 m/s east, and the time interval is 46 seconds. We can rearrange the average velocity
formula to solve for the displacement.
Solution

2.2

Discussion
The answer is about 110 m east, which is a reasonable displacement for slightly less than a minute of jogging. A calculator shows
the answer as 110.4 m. We chose to write the answer using scientific notation because we wanted to make it clear that we only

used two significant figures.
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Dimensional analysis is a good way to determine whether you solved a problem correctly. Write the calculation using only
units to be sure they match on opposite sides of the equal mark. In the worked example, you have
m = (m/s)(s). Since seconds is in the denominator for the average velocity and in the numerator for the time, the unit cancels
out leaving only m and, of course, m = m.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Solving for Time when Displacement and Average Velocity are Known

Phillip walks along a straight path from his house to his school. How long will it take him to get to school if he walks 428 m west
with an average velocity of 1.7 m/s west?
Strategy
We know that Phillip's displacement is 428 m west, and his average velocity is 1.7 m/s west. We can calculate the time required
for the trip by rearranging the average velocity equation.
Solution

2.3

Discussion
Here again we had to use scientific notation because the answer could only have two significant figures. Since time is a scalar,
the answer includes only a magnitude and not a direction.

Graphing Position as a Function of Time
A graph, like a picture, is worth a thousand words. Graphs not only contain numerical information, they also reveal
relationships between physical quantities. In this section, we will investigate kinematics by analyzing graphs of position over
time.
Graphs in this text have perpendicular axes, one horizontal and the other vertical. When two physical quantities are plotted
against each other, the horizontal axis is usually considered the independent variable, and the vertical axis is the dependent
variable. In algebra, you would have referred to the horizontal axis as the x-axis and the vertical axis as the y-axis. As in Figure
2.10, a straight-line graph has the general form
.

67

68

Chapter 2 • Motion in One Dimension

Here m is the slope, defined as the rise divided by the run (as seen in the figure) of the straight line. The letter b is the y-intercept
which is the point at which the line crosses the vertical, y-axis. In terms of a physical situation in the real world, these quantities
will take on a specific significance, as we will see below. (Figure 2.10.)

Figure 2.10 The diagram shows a straight-line graph. The equation for the straight line is y equals mx + b.

In physics, time is usually the independent variable. Other quantities, such as displacement, are said to depend upon it. A graph
of position versus time, therefore, would have position on the vertical axis (dependent variable) and time on the horizontal axis
(independent variable). In this case, to what would the slope and y-intercept refer? Let’s look back at our original example when
studying distance and displacement.
The drive to school was 5 km from home. Let’s assume it took 10 minutes to make the drive and that your parent was driving at a
constant velocity the whole time. The position versus time graph for this section of the trip would look like that shown in Figure
2.11.

Figure 2.11 A graph of position versus time for the drive to school is shown. What would the graph look like if we added the return trip?

As we said before, d0 = 0 because we call home our O and start calculating from there. In Figure 2.11, the line starts at d = 0, as
well. This is the b in our equation for a straight line. Our initial position in a position versus time graph is always the place where
the graph crosses the x-axis at t = 0. What is the slope? The rise is the change in position, (i.e., displacement) and the run is the
change in time. This relationship can also be written
2.4
This relationship was how we defined average velocity. Therefore, the slope in a d versus t graph, is the average velocity.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Sometimes, as is the case where we graph both the trip to school and the return trip, the behavior of the graph looks different
during different time intervals. If the graph looks like a series of straight lines, then you can calculate the average velocity for
each time interval by looking at the slope. If you then want to calculate the average velocity for the entire trip, you can do a

weighted average.
Let’s look at another example. Figure 2.12 shows a graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on a very flat dry lake bed
in Nevada.

Figure 2.12 The diagram shows a graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on the Bonneville Salt Flats.

Using the relationship between dependent and independent variables, we see that the slope in the graph in Figure 2.12 is average
velocity, vavg and the intercept is displacement at time zero—that is, d0. Substituting these symbols into y = mx + b gives
2.5
or
2.6
Thus a graph of position versus time gives a general relationship among displacement, velocity, and time, as well as giving
detailed numerical information about a specific situation. From the figure we can see that the car has a position of 400 m at t = 0
s, 650 m at t = 1.0 s, and so on. And we can learn about the object’s velocity, as well.

1. Choose two points on the line. In this case, we choose the points labeled on the graph: (6.4 s, 2000 m) and (0.50 s, 525 m).
(Note, however, that you could choose any two points.)
2. Substitute the d and t values of the chosen points into the equation. Remember in calculating change (Δ) we always use
final value minus initial value.

Discussion
This is an impressively high land speed (900 km/h, or about 560 mi/h): much greater than the typical highway speed limit of 27
m/s or 96 km/h, but considerably shy of the record of 343 m/s or 1,234 km/h, set in 1997.
But what if the graph of the position is more complicated than a straight line? What if the object speeds up or turns around and
goes backward? Can we figure out anything about its velocity from a graph of that kind of motion? Let’s take another look at the
jet-powered car. The graph in Figure 2.13 shows its motion as it is getting up to speed after starting at rest. Time starts at zero
for this motion (as if measured with a stopwatch), and the displacement and velocity are initially 200 m and 15 m/s, respectively.

Figure 2.13 The diagram shows a graph of the position of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up. The slope of a

point.

The graph of position versus time in Figure 2.13 is a curve rather than a straight line. The slope of the curve becomes steeper as
time progresses, showing that the velocity is increasing over time. The slope at any point on a position-versus-time graph is the
instantaneous velocity at that point. It is found by drawing a straight line tangent to the curve at the point of interest and taking
the slope of this straight line. Tangent lines are shown for two points in Figure 2.13. The average velocity is the net displacement
divided by the time traveled.

Graphing Velocity as a Function of Time
Earlier, we examined graphs of position versus time. Now, we are going to build on that information as we look at graphs of

acceleration more in another chapter. These concepts are all very interrelated.

What can we learn about motion by looking at velocity vs. time graphs? Let’s return to our drive to school, and look at a graph of
position versus time as shown in Figure 2.15.

73

74

Chapter 2 • Motion in One Dimension

Figure 2.15 A graph of position versus time for the drive to and from school is shown.

We assumed for our original calculation that your parent drove with a constant velocity to and from school. We now know that
the car could not have gone from rest to a constant velocity without speeding up. So the actual graph would be curved on either
end, but let’s make the same approximation as we did then, anyway.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

It is common in physics, especially at the early learning stages, for certain things to be neglected, as we see here. This is
because it makes the concept clearer or the calculation easier. Practicing physicists use these kinds of short-cuts, as well. It
works out because usually the thing being neglected is small enough that it does not significantly affect the answer. In the
earlier example, the amount of time it takes the car to speed up and reach its cruising velocity is very small compared to the
total time traveled.
Looking at this graph, and given what we learned, we can see that there are two distinct periods to the car’s motion—the way to
school and the way back. The average velocity for the drive to school is 0.5 km/minute. We can see that the average velocity for
the drive back is –0.5 km/minute. If we plot the data showing velocity versus time, we get another graph (Figure 2.16):

Figure 2.16 Graph of velocity versus time for the drive to and from school.

We can learn a few things. First, we can derive a v versus t graph from a d versus t graph. Second, if we have a straight-line
position–time graph that is positively or negatively sloped, it will yield a horizontal velocity graph. There are a few other
interesting things to note. Just as we could use a position vs. time graph to determine velocity, we can use a velocity vs. time
graph to determine position. We know that v = d/t. If we use a little algebra to re-arrange the equation, we see that d = v t. In
Figure 2.16, we have velocity on the y-axis and time along the x-axis. Let’s take just the first half of the motion. We get 0.5 km/
minute 10 minutes. The units for minutes cancel each other, and we get 5 km, which is the displacement for the trip to school.
If we calculate the same for the return trip, we get –5 km. If we add them together, we see that the net displacement for the

Access for free at openstax.org.

2.4 • Velocity vs. Time Graphs

whole trip is 0 km, which it should be because we started and ended at the same place.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
You can treat units just like you treat numbers, so a km/km=1 (or, we say, it cancels out). This is good because it can tell us
whether or not we have calculated everything with the correct units. For instance, if we end up with m × s for velocity instead
of m/s, we know that something has gone wrong, and we need to check our math. This process is called dimensional
analysis, and it is one of the best ways to check if your math makes sense in physics.
The area under a velocity curve represents the displacement. The velocity curve also tells us whether the car is speeding up. In
our earlier example, we stated that the velocity was constant. So, the car is not speeding up. Graphically, you can see that the
slope of these two lines is 0. This slope tells us that the car is not speeding up, or accelerating. We will do more with this
information in a later chapter. For now, just remember that the area under the graph and the slope are the two important parts
of the graph. Just like we could define a linear equation for the motion in a position vs. time graph, we can also define one for a
velocity vs. time graph. As we said, the slope equals the acceleration, a. And in this graph, the y-intercept is v0. Thus,
.
But what if the velocity is not constant? Let’s look back at our jet-car example. At the beginning of the motion, as the car is
speeding up, we saw that its position is a curve, as shown in Figure 2.17.

Figure 2.17 A graph is shown of the position of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up. The slope of a d vs. t graph is
velocity. This is shown at two points. Instantaneous velocity at any point is the slope of the tangent at that point.

You do not have to do this, but you could, theoretically, take the instantaneous velocity at each point on this graph. If you did,
you would get Figure 2.18, which is just a straight line with a positive slope.

75

76

Chapter 2 • Motion in One Dimension

Figure 2.18 The graph shows the velocity of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up.

Again, if we take the slope of the velocity vs. time graph, we get the acceleration, the rate of change of the velocity. And, if we
take the area under the slope, we get back to the displacement.

Solving Problems using Velocity–Time Graphs
Most velocity vs. time graphs will be straight lines. When this is the case, our calculations are fairly simple.

Solution
a. 1. Analyze the shape of the area to be calculated. In this case, the area is made up of a rectangle between 0 and 20 m/s
stretching to 30 s. The area of a rectangle is length width. Therefore, the area of this piece is 600 m.
2. Above that is a triangle whose base is 30 s and height is 140 m/s. The area of a triangle is 0.5 length width. The area
of this piece, therefore, is 2,100 m.

1. Take two points on the velocity line. Say, t = 5 s and t = 25 s. At t = 5 s, the value of v = 40 m/s.
At t = 25 s, v = 140 m/s.
2. Find the slope.

2.4 • Velocity vs. Time Graphs

Discussion
The average velocity we calculated here makes sense if we look at the graph. 100m/s falls about halfway across the graph and
since it is a straight line, we would expect about half the velocity to be above and half below.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
You can have negative position, velocity, and acceleration on a graph that describes the way the object is moving. You should
never see a graph with negative time on an axis. Why?
Most of the velocity vs. time graphs we will look at will be simple to interpret. Occasionally, we will look at curved graphs of
velocity vs. time. More often, these curved graphs occur when something is speeding up, often from rest. Let’s look back at a
more realistic velocity vs. time graph of the jet car’s motion that takes this speeding up stage into account.

Figure 2.19 The graph shows a more accurate graph of the velocity of a jet-powered car during the time span when it is speeding up.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Using Curvy Velocity Graph to Calculate Some Stuff: jet car, Take Two

Use Figure 2.19 to (a) find the approximate displacement of the jet car over the time shown, (b) calculate the instantaneous
acceleration at t = 30 s, (c) find the instantaneous velocity at 30 s, and (d) calculate the approximate average velocity over the
interval shown.
Strategy
a. Because this graph is an undefined curve, we have to estimate shapes over smaller intervals in order to find the areas.
b. Like when we were working with a curved displacement graph, we will need to take a tangent line at the instant we are
interested and use that to calculate the instantaneous acceleration.
c. The instantaneous velocity can still be read off of the graph.
d. We will find the average velocity the same way we did in the previous example.
Solution
a. 1. This problem is more complicated than the last example. To get a good estimate, we should probably break the curve
into four sections. 0 → 10 s, 10 → 20 s, 20 → 40 s, and 40 → 70 s.
2. Calculate the bottom rectangle (common to all pieces). 165 m/s 70 s = 11,550 m.
3. Estimate a triangle at the top, and calculate the area for each section. Section 1 = 225 m; section 2 = 100 m + 450 m =
550 m; section 3 = 150 m + 1,300 m = 1,450 m; section 4 = 2,550 m.
4. Add them together to get a net displacement of 16,325 m.
b. Using the tangent line given, we find that the slope is 1 m/s2.

c. The instantaneous velocity at t = 30 s, is 240 m/s.
d. 1. Find the net displacement, which we found in part (a), was 16,325 m.
2. Find the total time, which for this case is 70 s.
3. Divide
Discussion
This is a much more complicated process than the first problem. If we were to use these estimates to come up with the average
velocity over just the first 30 s we would get about 191 m/s. By approximating that curve with a line, we get an average velocity of
202.5 m/s. Depending on our purposes and how precise an answer we need, sometimes calling a curve a straight line is a
worthwhile approximation.

• Average speed is a scalar quantity that describes
distance traveled divided by the time during which the
motion occurs.
• Velocity is a vector quantity that describes the speed

• The slope of a position vs. time graph is the velocity.
• For a straight line graph of position, the slope is the

Chapter Outline
3.1 Acceleration
3.2 Representing Acceleration with Equations and Graphs

INTRODUCTION You may have heard the term accelerator, referring to the gas pedal in a car. When the gas pedal is pushed
down, the flow of gasoline to the engine increases, which increases the car’s velocity. Pushing on the gas pedal results in
acceleration because the velocity of the car increases, and acceleration is defined as a change in velocity. You need two quantities
to define velocity: a speed and a direction. Changing either of these quantities, or both together, changes the velocity. You may
be surprised to learn that pushing on the brake pedal or turning the steering wheel also causes acceleration. The first reduces the
speed and so changes the velocity, and the second changes the direction and also changes the velocity.
In fact, any change in velocity—whether positive, negative, directional, or any combination of these—is called an acceleration in
physics. The plane in the picture is said to be accelerating because its velocity is decreasing as it prepares to land. To begin our
study of acceleration, we need to have a clear understanding of what acceleration means.

Defining Acceleration
Throughout this chapter we will use the following terms: time, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Recall that each of these
terms has a designated variable and SI unit of measurement as follows:
•
•
•
•
•

Time: t, measured in seconds (s)
Displacement: Δd, measured in meters (m)
Velocity: v, measured in meters per second (m/s)
Acceleration: a, measured in meters per second per second (m/s2, also called meters per second squared)
Also note the following:
◦ Δ means change in
◦ The subscript 0 refers to an initial value; sometimes subscript i is instead used to refer to initial value.
◦ The subscript f refers to final value
◦ A bar over a symbol, such as , means average

Acceleration is the change in velocity divided by a period of time during which the change occurs. The SI units of velocity are m/s
and the SI units for time are s, so the SI units for acceleration are m/s2. Average acceleration is given by

Average acceleration is distinguished from instantaneous acceleration, which is acceleration at a specific instant in time. The
magnitude of acceleration is often not constant over time. For example, runners in a race accelerate at a greater rate in the first
second of a race than during the following seconds. You do not need to know all the instantaneous accelerations at all times to
calculate average acceleration. All you need to know is the change in velocity (i.e., the final velocity minus the initial velocity) and
the change in time (i.e., the final time minus the initial time), as shown in the formula. Note that the average acceleration can be
positive, negative, or zero. A negative acceleration is simply an acceleration in the negative direction.
Keep in mind that although acceleration points in the same direction as the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of
the velocity itself. When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its velocity. In everyday language,
this is called deceleration; but in physics, it is acceleration—whose direction happens to be opposite that of the velocity. For now,
let us assume that motion to the right along the x-axis is positive and motion to the left is negative.
Figure 3.2 shows a car with positive acceleration in (a) and negative acceleration in (b). The arrows represent vectors showing
both direction and magnitude of velocity and acceleration.

Figure 3.2 The car is speeding up in (a) and slowing down in (b).

3.1 • Acceleration

Velocity and acceleration are both vector quantities. Recall that vectors have both magnitude and direction. An object traveling
at a constant velocity—therefore having no acceleration—does accelerate if it changes direction. So, turning the steering wheel
of a moving car makes the car accelerate because the velocity changes direction.

Virtual Physics

With this animation in , you can produce both variations of acceleration and velocity shown in Figure 3.2, plus a few more
variations. Vary the velocity and acceleration by sliding the red and green markers along the scales. Keeping the velocity
marker near zero will make the effect of acceleration more obvious. Try changing acceleration from positive to negative
while the man is moving. We will come back to this animation and look at the Charts view when we study graphical
representation of motion.

vector is set on the negative side of the scale? What does the car’s motion look like for the given scenario?
a. Part (a). The car is slowing down because the acceleration and the velocity vectors are acting in the opposite
direction.
b. Part (a). The car is speeding up because the acceleration and the velocity vectors are acting in the same direction.
c. Part (b). The car is slowing down because the acceleration and velocity vectors are acting in the opposite directions.
d. Part (b). The car is speeding up because the acceleration and the velocity vectors are acting in the same direction.

Calculating Average Acceleration
Look back at the equation for average acceleration. You can see that the calculation of average acceleration involves three values:
change in time, (Δt); change in velocity, (Δv); and acceleration (a).
Change in time is often stated as a time interval, and change in velocity can often be calculated by subtracting the initial velocity
from the final velocity. Average acceleration is then simply change in velocity divided by change in time. Before you begin
calculating, be sure that all distances and times have been converted to meters and seconds. Look at these examples of
acceleration of a subway train.

WORKED EXAMPLE
An Accelerating Subway Train

A subway train accelerates from rest to 30.0 km/h in 20.0 s. What is the average acceleration during that time interval?
Strategy
Start by making a simple sketch.

Figure 3.4

This problem involves four steps:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Convert to units of meters and seconds.
Determine the change in velocity.
Determine the change in time.
Use these values to calculate the average acceleration.

Solution
1. Identify the knowns. Be sure to read the problem for given information, which may not look like numbers. When the
problem states that the train starts from rest, you can write down that the initial velocity is 0 m/s. Therefore, v0 = 0; vf =
30.0 km/h; and Δt = 20.0 s.
2. Convert the units.
3.1
3. Calculate change in velocity,
where the plus sign means the change in
velocity is to the right.
4. We know Δt, so all we have to do is insert the known values into the formula for average acceleration.
3.2
Discussion
The plus sign in the answer means that acceleration is to the right. This is a reasonable conclusion because the train starts from
rest and ends up with a velocity directed to the right (i.e., positive). So, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in
velocity, as it should be.

WORKED EXAMPLE
An Accelerating Subway Train

Now, suppose that at the end of its trip, the train slows to a stop in 8.00 s from a speed of 30.0 km/h. What is its average
acceleration during this time?
Strategy
Again, make a simple sketch.

3.1 • Acceleration

Figure 3.5

In this case, the train is decelerating and its acceleration is negative because it is pointing to the left. As in the previous example,
we must find the change in velocity and change in time, then solve for acceleration.
Solution
1. Identify the knowns: v0 = 30.0 km/h; vf = 0; and Δt = 8.00 s.
2. Convert the units. From the first problem, we know that 30.0 km/h = 8.333 m/s.
where the minus sign means that the
3. Calculate change in velocity,
change in velocity points to the left.
4. We know Δt = 8.00 s, so all we have to do is insert the known values into the equation for average acceleration.
3.3
Discussion
The minus sign indicates that acceleration is to the left. This is reasonable because the train initially has a positive velocity in this
problem, and a negative acceleration would reduce the velocity. Again, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in
velocity, which is negative in this case. This acceleration can be called a deceleration because it has a direction opposite to the
velocity.
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
• It is easier to get plus and minus signs correct if you always assume that motion is away from zero and toward positive
values on the x-axis. This way v always starts off being positive and points to the right. If speed is increasing, then
acceleration is positive and also points to the right. If speed is decreasing, then acceleration is negative and points to
the left.
• It is a good idea to carry two extra significant figures from step-to-step when making calculations. Do not round off
with each step. When you arrive at the final answer, apply the rules of significant figures for the operations you carried
out and round to the correct number of digits. Sometimes this will make your answer slightly more accurate.

How the Kinematic Equations are Related to Acceleration
We are studying concepts related to motion: time, displacement, velocity, and especially acceleration. We are only concerned
with motion in one dimension. The kinematic equations apply to conditions of constant acceleration and show how these
concepts are related. Constant acceleration is acceleration that does not change over time. The first kinematic equation relates
displacement d, average velocity , and time t.
3.4
The initial displacement

is often 0, in which case the equation can be written as

99

100

Chapter 3 • Acceleration

This equation says that average velocity is displacement per unit time. We will express velocity in meters per second. If we graph
displacement versus time, as in Figure 3.6, the slope will be the velocity. Whenever a rate, such as velocity, is represented
graphically, time is usually taken to be the independent variable and is plotted along the x axis.

Figure 3.6 The slope of displacement versus time is velocity.

The second kinematic equation, another expression for average velocity
divided by two.

is simply the initial velocity plus the final velocity

3.5
Now we come to our main focus of this chapter; namely, the kinematic equations that describe motion with constant
acceleration. In the third kinematic equation, acceleration is the rate at which velocity increases, so velocity at any point equals
initial velocity plus acceleration multiplied by time
3.6
Note that this third kinematic equation does not have displacement in it. Therefore, if you do not know the displacement and are
not trying to solve for a displacement, this equation might be a good one to use.
The third kinematic equation is also represented by the graph in Figure 3.7.

The fourth kinematic equation shows how displacement is related to acceleration

, in which case the equation can be written as

3.2 • Representing Acceleration with Equations and Graphs

This equation tells us that, for constant acceleration, the slope of a plot of 2d versus t2 is acceleration, as shown in Figure 3.8.

Figure 3.8 When acceleration is constant, the slope of 2d versus t2 gives the acceleration.

The fifth kinematic equation relates velocity, acceleration, and displacement
3.8
This equation is useful for when we do not know, or do not need to know, the time.
When starting from rest, the fifth equation simplifies to

According to this equation, a graph of velocity squared versus twice the displacement will have a slope equal to acceleration.

Figure 3.9

Note that, in reality, knowns and unknowns will vary. Sometimes you will want to rearrange a kinematic equation so that the
knowns are the values on the axes and the unknown is the slope. Sometimes the intercept will not be at the origin (0,0). This will
happen when v0 or d0 is not zero. This will be the case when the object of interest is already in motion, or the motion begins at
some point other than at the origin of the coordinate system.

Applying Kinematic Equations to Situations of Constant Acceleration
Problem-solving skills are essential to success in a science and life in general. The ability to apply broad physical principles,
which are often represented by equations, to specific situations is a very powerful form of knowledge. It is much more powerful

facts cannot be made long enough to contain every possible circumstance. Essential analytical skills will be developed by solving
problems in this text and will be useful for understanding physics and science in general throughout your life.

Problem-Solving Steps
While no single step-by-step method works for every problem, the following general procedures facilitate problem solving and
make the answers more meaningful. A certain amount of creativity and insight are required as well.
1. Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved. It is vital to draw a simple sketch at the outset.
Decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch.
2. Identify the knowns: Make a list of what information is given or can be inferred from the problem statement. Remember,
not all given information will be in the form of a number with units in the problem. If something starts from rest, we know
the initial velocity is zero. If something stops, we know the final velocity is zero.
3. Identify the unknowns: Decide exactly what needs to be determined in the problem.
4. Find an equation or set of equations that can help you solve the problem. Your list of knowns and unknowns can help here.
For example, if time is not needed or not given, then the fifth kinematic equation, which does not include time, could be
useful.
5. Insert the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with
units. This step produces the numerical answer; it also provides a check on units that can help you find errors. If the units
of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made.
6. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? This final step is extremely important because the goal of
physics is to accurately describe nature. To see if the answer is reasonable, check its magnitude, its sign, and its units. Are
the significant figures correct?

Summary of Problem Solving
• Determine the knowns and unknowns.
• Find an equation that expresses the unknown in terms of the knowns. More than one unknown means more than one
equation is needed.
• Solve the equation or equations.

FUN IN PHYSICS
Drag Racing

Figure 3.10 Smoke rises from the tires of a dragster at the beginning of a drag race. (Lt. Col. William Thurmond. Photo courtesy of U.S.
Army.)

The object of the sport of drag racing is acceleration. Period! The races take place from a standing start on a straight onequarter-mile (402 m) track. Usually two cars race side by side, and the winner is the driver who gets the car past the quarter-mile
point first. At the finish line, the cars may be going more than 300 miles per hour (134 m/s). The driver then deploys a parachute
to bring the car to a stop because it is unsafe to brake at such high speeds. The cars, called dragsters, are capable of accelerating
at 26 m/s2. By comparison, a typical sports car that is available to the general public can accelerate at about 5 m/s2.
Several measurements are taken during each drag race:
• Reaction time is the time between the starting signal and when the front of the car crosses the starting line.
• Elapsed time is the time from when the vehicle crosses the starting line to when it crosses the finish line. The record is a
little over 3 s.
• Speed is the average speed during the last 20 m before the finish line. The record is a little under 400 mph.
The video shows a race between two dragsters powered by jet engines. The actual race lasts about four seconds and is near the
end of the video (https://openstax.org/l/28dragsters) .

Discussion
145 m/s is about 522 km/hour or about 324 mi/h, but even this breakneck speed is short of the record for the quarter mile. Also,
note that a square root has two values. We took the positive value because we know that the velocity must be in the same
direction as the acceleration for the answer to make physical sense.
An examination of the equation

• The final velocity depends on the magnitude of the acceleration and the distance over which it applies.
• For a given acceleration, a car that is going twice as fast does not stop in twice the distance—it goes much further before it
stops. This is why, for example, we have reduced speed zones near schools.

c. 19.6 m/s
d. 44.1 m/s

Constant Acceleration
In many cases, acceleration is not uniform because the force acting on the accelerating object is not constant over time. A
situation that gives constant acceleration is the acceleration of falling objects. When air resistance is not a factor, all objects near
Earth’s surface fall with an acceleration of about 9.80 m/s2. Although this value decreases slightly with increasing altitude, it
may be assumed to be essentially constant. The value of 9.80 m/s2 is labeled g and is referred to as acceleration due to gravity.
Gravity is the force that causes nonsupported objects to accelerate downward—or, more precisely, toward the center of Earth.
The magnitude of this force is called the weight of the object and is given by mg where m is the mass of the object (in kg). In
places other than on Earth, such as the Moon or on other planets, g is not 9.80 m/s2, but takes on other values. When using g for
the acceleration a in a kinematic equation, it is usually given a negative sign because the acceleration due to gravity is
downward.

WORK IN PHYSICS
Effects of Rapid Acceleration

Figure 3.11 Astronauts train using G Force Simulators. (NASA)

When in a vehicle that accelerates rapidly, you experience a force on your entire body that accelerates your body. You feel this
force in automobiles and slightly more on amusement park rides. For example, when you ride in a car that turns, the car applies
a force on your body to make you accelerate in the direction in which the car is turning. If enough force is applied, you will
accelerate at 9.80 m/s2. This is the same as the acceleration due to gravity, so this force is called one G.
One G is the force required to accelerate an object at the acceleration due to gravity at Earth’s surface. Thus, one G for a paper
cup is much less than one G for an elephant, because the elephant is much more massive and requires a greater force to make it
accelerate at 9.80 m/s2. For a person, a G of about 4 is so strong that his or her face will distort as the bones accelerate forward
through the loose flesh. Other symptoms at extremely high Gs include changes in vision, loss of consciousness, and even death.
The space shuttle produces about 3 Gs during takeoff and reentry. Some roller coasters and dragsters produce forces of around 4
Gs for their occupants. A fighter jet can produce up to 12 Gs during a sharp turn.
Astronauts and fighter pilots must undergo G-force training in simulators. The video (https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=n-8QHOUWECU) shows the experience of several people undergoing this training.
People, such as astronauts, who work with G forces must also be trained to experience zero G—also called free fall or
weightlessness—which can cause queasiness. NASA has an aircraft that allows it occupants to experience about 25 s of free fall.
The aircraft is nicknamed the Vomit Comet.
GRASP CHECK
A common way to describe acceleration is to express it in multiples of g, Earth's gravitational acceleration. If a dragster

c. 10.5 g
d. 24.5 g

These equations describe the unknowns in terms of knowns only.
Solution

Discussion
The first two positive values for y show that the rock is still above the edge of the cliff, and the third negative y value shows that it
has passed the starting point and is below the cliff. Remember that we set up to be positive. Any position with a positive value is
above the cliff, and any velocity with a positive value is an upward velocity. The first value for v is positive, so the rock is still on
the way up. The second and third values for v are negative, so the rock is on its way down.
(b) Make graphs of position versus time, velocity versus time, and acceleration versus time. Use increments of 0.5 s in your
graphs.
Strategy
Time is customarily plotted on the x-axis because it is the independent variable. Position versus time will not be linear, so
calculate points for 0.50 s, 1.50 s, and 2.50 s. This will give a curve closer to the true, smooth shape.

The three graphs are shown in Figure 3.13.

Discussion
• y vs. t does not represent the two-dimensional parabolic path of a trajectory. The path of the rock is straight up and straight
down. The slope of a line tangent to the curve at any point on the curve equals the velocity at that point—i.e., the
instantaneous velocity.

Chapter 3 • Acceleration

• Note that the v vs. t line crosses the vertical axis at the initial velocity and crosses the horizontal axis at the time when the
rock changes direction and begins to fall back to Earth. This plot is linear because acceleration is constant.
• The a vs. t plot also shows that acceleration is constant; that is, it does not change with time.

INTRODUCTION Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was a natural philosopher; a great thinker who combined science and philosophy to
try to explain the workings of nature on Earth and in the universe. His laws of motion were just one part of the monumental
work that has made him legendary. The development of Newton’s laws marks the transition from the Renaissance period of
history to the modern era. This transition was characterized by a revolutionary change in the way people thought about the
physical universe. Drawing upon earlier work by scientists Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler, Newton’s laws of motion allowed
motion on Earth and in space to be predicted mathematically. In this chapter you will learn about force as well as Newton’s first,

Defining Force and Dynamics
Force is the cause of motion, and motion draws our attention. Motion itself can be beautiful, such as a dolphin jumping out of
the water, the flight of a bird, or the orbit of a satellite. The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics describes only
the way objects move—their velocity and their acceleration. Dynamics considers the forces that affect the motion of moving
objects and systems. Newton’s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics. These laws describe the way objects speed up,
slow down, stay in motion, and interact with other objects. They are also universal laws: they apply everywhere on Earth as well
as in space.
A force pushes or pulls an object. The object being moved by a force could be an inanimate object, a table, or an animate object, a
person. The pushing or pulling may be done by a person, or even the gravitational pull of Earth. Forces have different
magnitudes and directions; this means that some forces are stronger than others and can act in different directions. For
example, a cannon exerts a strong force on the cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, a mosquito landing on your
arm exerts only a small force on your arm.
When multiple forces act on an object, the forces combine. Adding together all of the forces acting on an object gives the total
force, or net force. An external force is a force that acts on an object within the system from outside the system. This type of
force is different than an internal force, which acts between two objects that are both within the system. The net external force
combines these two definitions; it is the total combined external force. We discuss further details about net force, external force,
and net external force in the coming sections.
In mathematical terms, two forces acting in opposite directions have opposite signs (positive or negative). By convention, the
negative sign is assigned to any movement to the left or downward. If two forces pushing in opposite directions are added
together, the larger force will be somewhat canceled out by the smaller force pushing in the opposite direction. It is important to
be consistent with your chosen coordinate system within a problem; for example, if negative values are assigned to the
downward direction for velocity, then distance, force, and acceleration should also be designated as being negative in the
downward direction.

Free-Body Diagrams and Examples of Forces
For our first example of force, consider an object hanging from a rope. This example gives us the opportunity to introduce a
useful tool known as a free-body diagram. A free-body diagram represents the object being acted upon—that is, the free
body—as a single point. Only the forces acting on the body (that is, external forces) are shown and are represented by vectors
(which are drawn as arrows). These forces are the only ones shown because only external forces acting on the body affect its
motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body because they cancel each other out, as explained in the section on
Newton’s third law of motion. Free-body diagrams are very useful for analyzing forces acting on an object.

Figure 4.2 An object of mass, m, is held up by the force of tension.

Figure 4.2 shows the force of tension in the rope acting in the upward direction, opposite the force of gravity. The forces are
indicated in the free-body diagram by an arrow pointing up, representing tension, and another arrow pointing down,
representing gravity. In a free-body diagram, the lengths of the arrows show the relative magnitude (or strength) of the forces.
Because forces are vectors, they add just like other vectors. Notice that the two arrows have equal lengths in Figure 4.2, which
means that the forces of tension and weight are of equal magnitude. Because these forces of equal magnitude act in opposite
directions, they are perfectly balanced, so they add together to give a net force of zero.
Not all forces are as noticeable as when you push or pull on an object. Some forces act without physical contact, such as the pull
of a magnet (in the case of magnetic force) or the gravitational pull of Earth (in the case of gravitational force).
In the next three sections discussing Newton’s laws of motion, we will learn about three specific types of forces: friction, the
normal force, and the gravitational force. To analyze situations involving forces, we will create free-body diagrams to organize
the framework of the mathematics for each individual situation.

Newton’s First Law and Friction
Newton’s first law of motion states the following:
1. A body at rest tends to remain at rest.
2. A body in motion tends to remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force. (Recall that
constant velocity means that the body moves in a straight line and at a constant speed.)
At first glance, this law may seem to contradict your everyday experience. You have probably noticed that a moving object will
usually slow down and stop unless some effort is made to keep it moving. The key to understanding why, for example, a sliding
box slows down (seemingly on its own) is to first understand that a net external force acts on the box to make the box slow down.
Without this net external force, the box would continue to slide at a constant velocity (as stated in Newton’s first law of motion).
What force acts on the box to slow it down? This force is called friction. Friction is an external force that acts opposite to the
direction of motion (see Figure 4.3). Think of friction as a resistance to motion that slows things down.
Consider an air hockey table. When the air is turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction slows it to a stop.
However, when the air is turned on, it lifts the puck slightly, so the puck experiences very little friction as it moves over the
surface. With friction almost eliminated, the puck glides along with very little change in speed. On a frictionless surface, the
puck would experience no net external force (ignoring air resistance, which is also a form of friction). Additionally, if we know
enough about friction, we can accurately predict how quickly objects will slow down.
Now let’s think about another example. A man pushes a box across a floor at constant velocity by applying a force of
+50 N. (The positive sign indicates that, by convention, the direction of motion is to the right.) What is the force of friction that
opposes the motion? The force of friction must be −50 N. Why? According to Newton’s first law of motion, any object moving at
constant velocity has no net external force acting upon it, which means that the sum of the forces acting on the object must be

4.2 • Newton's First Law of Motion: Inertia

other). Whenever you encounter the phrase at constant velocity, Newton’s first law tells you that the net external force is zero.

Figure 4.3 For a box sliding across a floor, friction acts in the direction opposite to the velocity.

The force of friction depends on two factors: the coefficient of friction and the normal force. For any two surfaces that are in
contact with one another, the coefficient of friction is a constant that depends on the nature of the surfaces. The normal force is
the force exerted by a surface that pushes on an object in response to gravity pulling the object down. In equation form, the force
of friction is
4.1
where μ is the coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. (The coefficient of friction is discussed in more detail in another
chapter, and the normal force is discussed in more detail in the section Newton's Third Law of Motion.)
Recall from the section on Force that a net external force acts from outside on the object of interest. A more precise definition is
that it acts on the system of interest. A system is one or more objects that you choose to study. It is important to define the
system at the beginning of a problem to figure out which forces are external and need to be considered, and which are internal
and can be ignored.
For example, in Figure 4.4 (a), two children push a third child in a wagon at a constant velocity. The system of interest is the
wagon plus the small child, as shown in part (b) of the figure. The two children behind the wagon exert external forces on this
system (F1, F2). Friction f acting at the axles of the wheels and at the surface where the wheels touch the ground two other
external forces acting on the system. Two more external forces act on the system: the weight W of the system pulling down and
the normal force N of the ground pushing up. Notice that the wagon is not accelerating vertically, so Newton’s first law tells us
that the normal force balances the weight. Because the wagon is moving forward at a constant velocity, the force of friction must
have the same strength as the sum of the forces applied by the two children.

119

120

Chapter 4 • Forces and Newton’s Laws of Motion

Figure 4.4 (a) The wagon and rider form a system that is acted on by external forces. (b) The two children pushing the wagon and child
provide two external forces. Friction acting at the wheel axles and on the surface of the tires where they touch the ground provide an
external force that act against the direction of motion. The weight W and the normal force N from the ground are two more external forces
acting on the system. All external forces are represented in the figure by arrows. All of the external forces acting on the system add
together, but because the wagon moves at a constant velocity, all of the forces must add up to zero.

Mass and Inertia
Inertia is the tendency for an object at rest to remain at rest, or for a moving object to remain in motion in a straight line with
constant speed. This key property of objects was first described by Galileo. Later, Newton incorporated the concept of inertia
into his first law, which is often referred to as the law of inertia.
As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia than others. For example, changing the motion of a large truck is
more difficult than changing the motion of a toy truck. In fact, the inertia of an object is proportional to the mass of the object.
Mass is a measure of the amount of matter (or stuff) in an object. The quantity or amount of matter in an object is determined by
the number and types of atoms the object contains. Unlike weight (which changes if the gravitational force changes), mass does
not depend on gravity. The mass of an object is the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the moon. In practice, it is very
difficult to count and identify all of the atoms and molecules in an object, so mass is usually not determined this way. Instead,
the mass of an object is determined by comparing it with the standard kilogram. Mass is therefore expressed in kilograms.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

In everyday language, people often use the terms weight and mass interchangeably—but this is not correct. Weight is
actually a force. (We cover this topic in more detail in the section Newton's Second Law of Motion.)

Describing Newton’s Second Law of Motion
Newton’s first law considered bodies at rest or bodies in motion at a constant velocity. The other state of motion to consider is
when an object is moving with a changing velocity, which means a change in the speed and/or the direction of motion. This type
of motion is addressed by Newton’s second law of motion, which states how force causes changes in motion. Newton’s second
law of motion is used to calculate what happens in situations involving forces and motion, and it shows the mathematical
relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. Mathematically, the second law is most often written as
4.2
where Fnet (or ∑F) is the net external force, m is the mass of the system, and a is the acceleration. Note that Fnet and ∑F are the
same because the net external force is the sum of all the external forces acting on the system.
First, what do we mean by a change in motion? A change in motion is simply a change in velocity: the speed of an object can
become slower or faster, the direction in which the object is moving can change, or both of these variables may change. A change
in velocity means, by definition, that an acceleration has occurred. Newton’s first law says that only a nonzero net external force
can cause a change in motion, so a net external force must cause an acceleration. Note that acceleration can refer to slowing
down or to speeding up. Acceleration can also refer to a change in the direction of motion with no change in speed, because
acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time it takes for that change to occur, and velocity is defined by speed and
direction.
From the equation
we see that force is directly proportional to both mass and acceleration, which makes sense. To
accelerate two objects from rest to the same velocity, you would expect more force to be required to accelerate the more massive
object. Likewise, for two objects of the same mass, applying a greater force to one would accelerate it to a greater velocity.
Now, let’s rearrange Newton’s second law to solve for acceleration. We get
4.3
In this form, we can see that acceleration is directly proportional to force, which we write as
4.4
where the symbol

means proportional to.

This proportionality mathematically states what we just said in words: acceleration is directly proportional to the net external

4.3 • Newton's Second Law of Motion

force. When two variables are directly proportional to each other, then if one variable doubles, the other variable must double.
Likewise, if one variable is reduced by half, the other variable must also be reduced by half. In general, when one variable is
multiplied by a number, the other variable is also multiplied by the same number. It seems reasonable that the acceleration of a
system should be directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on the system. An object
experiences greater acceleration when acted on by a greater force.
It is also clear from the equation

that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass, which we write as
4.5

Inversely proportional means that if one variable is multiplied by a number, the other variable must be divided by the same
number. Now, it also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of the system. In other
words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force. This relationship is illustrated in
Figure 4.5, which shows that a given net external force applied to a basketball produces a much greater acceleration than when
applied to a car.

Figure 4.5 The same force exerted on systems of different masses produces different accelerations. (a) A boy pushes a basketball to make
a pass. The effect of gravity on the ball is ignored. (b) The same boy pushing with identical force on a stalled car produces a far smaller
acceleration (friction is negligible). Note that the free-body diagrams for the ball and for the car are identical, which allows us to compare
the two situations.

Applying Newton’s Second Law
Before putting Newton’s second law into action, it is important to consider units. The equation
is used to define the
units of force in terms of the three basic units of mass, length, and time (recall that acceleration has units of length divided by
time squared). The SI unit of force is called the newton (abbreviated N) and is the force needed to accelerate a 1-kg system at the
rate of 1 m/s2. That is, because
we have
4.6
One of the most important applications of Newton’s second law is to calculate weight (also known as the gravitational force),
which is usually represented mathematically as W. When people talk about gravity, they don’t always realize that it is an
acceleration. When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newton’s second law states that the net
external force acting on an object is responsible for the acceleration of the object. If air resistance is negligible, the net external
force on a falling object is only the gravitational force (i.e., the weight of the object).
Weight can be represented by a vector because it has a direction. Down is defined as the direction in which gravity pulls, so
weight is normally considered a downward force. By using Newton’s second law, we can figure out the equation for weight.
Consider an object with mass m falling toward Earth. It experiences only the force of gravity (i.e., the gravitational force or
weight), which is represented by W. Newton’s second law states that
Because the only force acting on the object is
the gravitational force, we have
We know that the acceleration of an object due to gravity is g, so we have
Substituting these two expressions into Newton’s second law gives

This is the equation for weight—the gravitational force on a mass m. On Earth,

so the weight (disregarding for
4.8

Although most of the world uses newtons as the unit of force, in the United States the most familiar unit of force is the pound
(lb), where 1 N = 0.225 lb.
Recall that although gravity acts downward, it can be assigned a positive or negative value, depending on what the positive
direction is in your chosen coordinate system. Be sure to take this into consideration when solving problems with weight. When
the downward direction is taken to be negative, as is often the case, acceleration due to gravity becomes
g = −9.8 m/s2.
When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in freefall. In this case, the only force acting on the object
is the force of gravity. On the surface of Earth, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are never truly in freefall because
there is always some upward force due to air resistance that acts on the object (and there is also the buoyancy force of air, which
is similar to the buoyancy force in water that keeps boats afloat).
Gravity varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so the weight of an object depends very slightly on its location on Earth. Weight
varies dramatically away from Earth’s surface. On the moon, for example, the acceleration due to gravity is only 1.67 m/s2.
Because weight depends on the force of gravity, a 1.0-kg mass weighs 9.8 N on Earth and only about 1.7 N on the moon.
It is important to remember that weight and mass are very different, although they are closely related. Mass is the quantity of
matter (how much stuff) in an object and does not vary, but weight is the gravitational force on an object and is proportional to
the force of gravity. It is easy to confuse the two, because our experience is confined to Earth, and the weight of an object is
essentially the same no matter where you are on Earth. Adding to the confusion, the terms mass and weight are often used
interchangeably in everyday language; for example, our medical records often show our weight in kilograms, but never in the
correct unit of newtons.

Discussion
The acceleration is in the same direction as the net external force, which is parallel to the ground and to the right. There is no
information given in this example about the individual external forces acting on the system, but we can say something about
their relative magnitudes. For example, the force exerted by the person pushing the mower must be greater than the friction
opposing the motion, because we are given that the net external force is in the direction in which the person pushes. Also, the
vertical forces must cancel if there is no acceleration in the vertical direction (the mower is moving only horizontally). The
acceleration found is reasonable for a person pushing a mower; the mower’s speed must increase by 0.21 m/s every second,
which is possible. The time during which the mower accelerates would not be very long because the person’s top speed would
soon be reached. At this point, the person could push a little less hard, because he only has to overcome friction.

Describing Newton’s Third Law of Motion
If you have ever stubbed your toe, you have noticed that although your toe initiates the impact, the surface that you stub it on
exerts a force back on your toe. Although the first thought that crosses your mind is probably “ouch, that hurt” rather than “this
is a great example of Newton’s third law,” both statements are true.
This is exactly what happens whenever one object exerts a force on another—each object experiences a force that is the same
strength as the force acting on the other object but that acts in the opposite direction. Everyday experiences, such as stubbing a
toe or throwing a ball, are all perfect examples of Newton’s third law in action.
Newton’s third law of motion states that whenever a first object exerts a force on a second object, the first object experiences a
force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.
Newton’s third law of motion tells us that forces always occur in pairs, and one object cannot exert a force on another without
experiencing the same strength force in return. We sometimes refer to these force pairs as action-reaction pairs, where the force
exerted is the action, and the force experienced in return is the reaction (although which is which depends on your point of
view).
Newton’s third law is useful for figuring out which forces are external to a system. Recall that identifying external forces is
important when setting up a problem, because the external forces must be added together to find the net force.
We can see Newton’s third law at work by looking at how people move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off from the side of a
pool, as illustrated in Figure 4.8. She pushes against the pool wall with her feet and accelerates in the direction opposite to her
push. The wall has thus exerted on the swimmer a force of equal magnitude but in the direction opposite that of her push. You
might think that two forces of equal magnitude but that act in opposite directions would cancel, but they do not because they act
on different systems.
In this case, there are two different systems that we could choose to investigate: the swimmer or the wall. If we choose the

Figure 4.8 When the swimmer exerts a force

on the wall, she accelerates in the direction opposite to that of her push. This

means that the net external force on her is in the direction opposite to
motion, which dictates that the wall exerts a force

This opposition is the result of Newton’s third law of

on the swimmer that is equal in magnitude but that acts in the direction

opposite to the force that the swimmer exerts on the wall.

Other examples of Newton’s third law are easy to find. As a teacher paces in front of a whiteboard, he exerts a force backward on
the floor. The floor exerts a reaction force in the forward direction on the teacher that causes him to accelerate forward.
Similarly, a car accelerates because the ground pushes forward on the car's wheels in reaction to the car's wheels pushing
backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw rocks
backward.
Another example is the force of a baseball as it makes contact with the bat. Helicopters create lift by pushing air down, creating
an upward reaction force. Birds fly by exerting force on air in the direction opposite that in which they wish to fly. For example,
the wings of a bird force air downward and backward in order to get lift and move forward. An octopus propels itself forward in
the water by ejecting water backward through a funnel in its body, which is similar to how a jet ski is propelled. In these
examples, the octopus or jet ski push the water backward, and the water, in turn, pushes the octopus or jet ski forward.

Applying Newton’s Third Law
Forces are classified and given names based on their source, how they are transmitted, or their effects. In previous sections, we
discussed the forces called push, weight, and friction. In this section, applying Newton’s third law of motion will allow us to
explore three more forces: the normal force, tension, and thrust. However, because we haven’t yet covered vectors in depth, we’ll
only consider one-dimensional situations in this chapter. Another chapter will consider forces acting in two dimensions.
The gravitational force (or weight) acts on objects at all times and everywhere on Earth. We know from Newton’s second law that
a net force produces an acceleration; so, why is everything not in a constant state of freefall toward the center of Earth? The
answer is the normal force. The normal force is the force that a surface applies to an object to support the weight of that object; it
acts perpendicular to the surface upon which the object rests. If an object on a flat surface is not accelerating, the net external
force is zero, and the normal force has the same magnitude as the weight of the system but acts in the opposite direction. In
equation form, we write that
4.17
Note that this equation is only true for a horizontal surface.
The word tension comes from the Latin word meaning to stretch. Tension is the force along the length of a flexible connector,
such as a string, rope, chain, or cable. Regardless of the type of connector attached to the object of interest, one must remember
that the connector can only pull (or exert tension) in the direction parallel to its length. Tension is a pull that acts parallel to the
connector, and that acts in opposite directions at the two ends of the connector. This is possible because a flexible connector is
simply a long series of action-reaction forces, except at the two ends where outside objects provide one member of the actionreaction forces.
Consider a person holding a mass on a rope, as shown in Figure 4.9.

129

130

Chapter 4 • Forces and Newton’s Laws of Motion

Figure 4.9 When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend it) such as a rope transmits a force T, this force must be
parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. The pull that such a flexible connector exerts is a tension. Note that the rope pulls with equal
magnitude force but in opposite directions to the hand and to the mass (neglecting the weight of the rope). This is an example of Newton’s
third law. The rope is the medium that transmits forces of equal magnitude between the two objects but that act in opposite directions.

Tension in the rope must equal the weight of the supported mass, as we can prove by using Newton’s second law. If the 5.00 kg
mass in the figure is stationary, then its acceleration is zero, so
The only external forces acting on the mass are its
weight W and the tension T supplied by the rope. Summing the external forces to find the net force, we obtain
4.18
where T and W are the magnitudes of the tension and weight, respectively, and their signs indicate direction, with up being
positive. By substituting mg for Fnet and rearranging the equation, the tension equals the weight of the supported mass, just as
you would expect
4.19
For a 5.00-kg mass (neglecting the mass of the rope), we see that
4.20
Another example of Newton’s third law in action is thrust. Rockets move forward by expelling gas backward at a high velocity.
This means that the rocket exerts a large force backward on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber, and the gas, in turn,
exerts a large force forward on the rocket in response. This reaction force is called thrust.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
A common misconception is that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the ground or on the air behind them. They
actually work better in a vacuum, where they can expel exhaust gases more easily.

is important to draw a careful sketch of the situation. An example of a sketch is shown in Figure 4.10. Next, as in Figure 4.10, use
vectors to represent all forces. Label the forces carefully, and make sure that their lengths are proportional to the magnitude of
the forces and that the arrows point in the direction in which the forces act.

external forces acting on Tarzan. For these to sum to zero, we must have

Next, make a list of knowns and unknowns and assign variable names to the quantities given in the problem. Figure out which
variables need to be calculated; these are the unknowns. Now carefully define the system: which objects are of interest for the
problem. This decision is important, because Newton’s second law involves only external forces. Once the system is identified,
it’s possible to see which forces are external and which are internal (see Figure 4.10).
If the system acts on an object outside the system, then you know that the outside object exerts a force of equal magnitude but in
the opposite direction on the system.
A diagram showing the system of interest and all the external forces acting on it is called a free-body diagram. Only external
forces are shown on free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. Figure 4.10 shows a free-body diagram for the system of
interest.
After drawing a free-body diagram, apply Newton’s second law to solve the problem. This is done in Figure 4.10 for the case of
Tarzan hanging from a vine. When external forces are clearly identified in the free-body diagram, translate the forces into
equation form and solve for the unknowns. Note that forces acting in opposite directions have opposite signs. By convention,
forces acting downward or to the left are usually negative.

An Accelerating Subway Train

A physics teacher pushes a cart of demonstration equipment to a classroom, as in Figure 4.11. Her mass is 65.0 kg, the cart’s
mass is 12.0 kg, and the equipment’s mass is 7.0 kg. To push the cart forward, the teacher’s foot applies a force of 150 N in the
opposite direction (backward) on the floor. Calculate the acceleration produced by the teacher. The force of friction, which
opposes the motion, is 24.0 N.

, or
because these are exerted by the system, not on the system. We find the
net external force by adding together the external forces acting on the system (see the free-body diagram in the figure) and then
use Newton’s second law to find the acceleration.
Solution
Newton’s second law is
4.21
The net external force on the system is the sum of the external forces: the force of the floor acting on the teacher, cart, and
equipment (in the horizontal direction) and the force of friction. Because friction acts in the opposite direction, we assign it a
negative value. Thus, for the net force, we obtain

4.25
Discussion
None of the forces between components of the system, such as between the teacher’s hands and the cart, contribute to the net
external force because they are internal to the system. Another way to look at this is to note that the forces between components
of a system cancel because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, the force exerted by the teacher
on the cart is of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction of the force exerted by the cart on the teacher. In this case, both
forces act on the same system, so they cancel. Defining the system was crucial to solving this problem.

SECTION SUMMARY
4.1 Force
• Dynamics is the study of how forces affect the motion of
objects and systems.
• Force is a push or pull that can be defined in terms of
various standards. It is a vector and so has both
magnitude and direction.
• External forces are any forces outside of a body that act
on the body. A free-body diagram is a drawing of all
external forces acting on a body.

4.2 Newton's First Law of Motion:
Inertia
• Newton’s first law states that a body at rest remains at
rest or, if moving, remains in motion in a straight line
at a constant speed, unless acted on by a net external
force. This law is also known as the law of inertia.
• Inertia is the tendency of an object at rest to remain at
rest or, if moving, to remain in motion at constant
velocity. Inertia is related to an object’s mass.

• Friction is a force that opposes motion and causes an
object or system to slow down.
• Mass is the quantity of matter in a substance.

4.3 Newton's Second Law of Motion
• Acceleration is a change in velocity, meaning a change
in speed, direction, or both.
• An external force acts on a system from outside the
system, as opposed to internal forces, which act
between components within the system.
• Newton’s second law of motion states that the
acceleration of a system is directly proportional to and
in the same direction as the net external force acting on
the system, and inversely proportional to the system’s
mass.
• In equation form, Newton’s second law of motion is

or
.
• The weight of an object of mass m is the force of gravity
that acts on it. From Newton’s second law, weight is

given by
• If the only force acting on an object is its weight, then
the object is in freefall.

4.4 Newton's Third Law of Motion
• Newton’s third law of motion states that when one body
exerts a force on a second body, the first body
experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and
opposite in direction to the force that it exerts.
• When an object rests on a surface, the surface applies a
force on the object that opposes the weight of the object.

This force acts perpendicular to the surface and is called
the normal force.
• The pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible
connector, such as a rope or cable, is called tension.
When a rope supports the weight of an object at rest,
the tension in the rope is equal to the weight of the
object.
• Thrust is a force that pushes an object forward in
response to the backward ejection of mass by the object.
Rockets and airplanes are pushed forward by thrust.

INTRODUCTION In Chapter 2, we learned to distinguish between vectors and scalars; the difference being that a vector has
magnitude and direction, whereas a scalar has only magnitude. We learned how to deal with vectors in physics by working
straightforward one-dimensional vector problems, which may be treated mathematically in the same as scalars. In this chapter,
we’ll use vectors to expand our understanding of forces and motion into two dimensions. Most real-world physics problems
(such as with the game of pool pictured here) are, after all, either two- or three-dimensional problems and physics is most useful
when applied to real physical scenarios. We start by learning the practical skills of graphically adding and subtracting vectors (by
using drawings) and analytically (with math). Once we’re able to work with two-dimensional vectors, we apply these skills to
problems of projectile motion, inclined planes, and harmonic motion.

The Graphical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction
Recall that a vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. For example, displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force
are all vectors. In one-dimensional or straight-line motion, the direction of a vector can be given simply by a plus or minus sign.
Motion that is forward, to the right, or upward is usually considered to be positive (+); and motion that is backward, to the left,
or downward is usually considered to be negative (−).
In two dimensions, a vector describes motion in two perpendicular directions, such as vertical and horizontal. For vertical and
horizontal motion, each vector is made up of vertical and horizontal components. In a one-dimensional problem, one of the
components simply has a value of zero. For two-dimensional vectors, we work with vectors by using a frame of reference such as
a coordinate system. Just as with one-dimensional vectors, we graphically represent vectors with an arrow having a length
proportional to the vector’s magnitude and pointing in the direction that the vector points.
Figure 5.2 shows a graphical representation of a vector; the total displacement for a person walking in a city. The person first
walks nine blocks east and then five blocks north. Her total displacement does not match her path to her final destination. The
displacement simply connects her starting point with her ending point using a straight line, which is the shortest distance. We
use the notation that a boldface symbol, such as D, stands for a vector. Its magnitude is represented by the symbol in italics, D,
and its direction is given by an angle represented by the symbol Note that her displacement would be the same if she had
begun by first walking five blocks north and then walking nine blocks east.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
In this text, we represent a vector with a boldface variable. For example, we represent a force with the vector F, which has
both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of the vector is represented by the variable in italics, F, and the direction of
the variable is given by the angle

Figure 5.2 A person walks nine blocks east and five blocks north. The displacement is 10.3 blocks at an angle

north of east.

The head-to-tail method is a graphical way to add vectors. The tail of the vector is the starting point of the vector, and the head
(or tip) of a vector is the pointed end of the arrow. The following steps describe how to use the head-to-tail method for graphical
vector addition.

5.1 • Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods

1. Let the x-axis represent the east-west direction. Using a ruler and protractor, draw an arrow to represent the first vector
(nine blocks to the east), as shown in Figure 5.3(a).

Figure 5.3 The diagram shows a vector with a magnitude of nine units and a direction of 0°.

2. Let the y-axis represent the north-south direction. Draw an arrow to represent the second vector (five blocks to the north).
Place the tail of the second vector at the head of the first vector, as shown in Figure 5.4(b).

Figure 5.4 A vertical vector is added.

3. If there are more than two vectors, continue to add the vectors head-to-tail as described in step 2. In this example, we have
only two vectors, so we have finished placing arrows tip to tail.
4. Draw an arrow from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector, as shown in Figure 5.5(c). This is the resultant,
or the sum, of the vectors.

5. To find the magnitude of the resultant, measure its length with a ruler. When we deal with vectors analytically in the next
section, the magnitude will be calculated by using the Pythagorean theorem.
6. To find the direction of the resultant, use a protractor to measure the angle it makes with the reference direction (in this
case, the x-axis). When we deal with vectors analytically in the next section, the direction will be calculated by using
trigonometry to find the angle.

;
a. Yes, if we add the same two vectors in a different order it will still give the same resultant vector.
b. No, the resultant vector will change if we add the same vectors in a different order.

Vector subtraction is done in the same way as vector addition with one small change. We add the first vector to the negative of
the vector that needs to be subtracted. A negative vector has the same magnitude as the original vector, but points in the
opposite direction (as shown in Figure 5.6). Subtracting the vector B from the vector A, which is written as A − B, is the same as
A + (−B). Since it does not matter in what order vectors are added, A − B is also equal to (−B) + A. This is true for scalars as well as
vectors. For example, 5 – 2 = 5 + (−2) = (−2) + 5.

Figure 5.6 The diagram shows a vector, B, and the negative of this vector, –B.

Global angles are calculated in the counterclockwise direction. The clockwise direction is considered negative. For example, an
angle of
south of west is the same as the global angle
which can also be expressed as
from the positive x-axis.

Using the Graphical Method of Vector Addition and Subtraction to Solve
Physics Problems
Now that we have the skills to work with vectors in two dimensions, we can apply vector addition to graphically determine the
resultant vector, which represents the total force. Consider an example of force involving two ice skaters pushing a third as seen
in Figure 5.7.

Figure 5.7 Part (a) shows an overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third. Forces are vectors and add like vectors, so the total force
on the third skater is in the direction shown. In part (b), we see a free-body diagram representing the forces acting on the third skater.

In problems where variables such as force are already known, the forces can be represented by making the length of the vectors
proportional to the magnitudes of the forces. For this, you need to create a scale. For example, each centimeter of vector length
could represent 50 N worth of force. Once you have the initial vectors drawn to scale, you can then use the head-to-tail method
to draw the resultant vector. The length of the resultant can then be measured and converted back to the original units using the
scale you created.
You can tell by looking at the vectors in the free-body diagram in Figure 5.7 that the two skaters are pushing on the third skater
with equal-magnitude forces, since the length of their force vectors are the same. Note, however, that the forces are not equal
because they act in different directions. If, for example, each force had a magnitude of 400 N, then we would find the magnitude
of the total external force acting on the third skater by finding the magnitude of the resultant vector. Since the forces act at a
right angle to one another, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. For a triangle with sides a, b, and c, the Pythagorean theorem
tells us that

Applying this theorem to the triangle made by F1, F2, and Ftot in Figure 5.7, we get

147

148

Chapter 5 • Motion in Two Dimensions

or

Note that, if the vectors were not at a right angle to each other
to one another), we would not be able to use the
Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector. Another scenario where adding two-dimensional vectors is
necessary is for velocity, where the direction may not be purely east-west or north-south, but some combination of these two
directions. In the next section, we cover how to solve this type of problem analytically. For now let’s consider the problem
graphically.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Adding Vectors Graphically by Using the Head-to-Tail Method: A Woman Takes a Walk

Use the graphical technique for adding vectors to find the total displacement of a person who walks the following three paths
north of east. Then, he walks 23 m heading
north of
(displacements) on a flat field. First, he walks 25 m in a direction
east. Finally, he turns and walks 32 m in a direction
south of east.
Strategy
Graphically represent each displacement vector with an arrow, labeling the first A, the second B, and the third C. Make the
lengths proportional to the distance of the given displacement and orient the arrows as specified relative to an east-west line.
Use the head-to-tail method outlined above to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant displacement, which
we’ll call R.
Solution
(1) Draw the three displacement vectors, creating a convenient scale (such as 1 cm of vector length on paper equals 1 m in the
problem), as shown in Figure 5.8.

Figure 5.8 The three displacement vectors are drawn first.

(2) Place the vectors head to tail, making sure not to change their magnitude or direction, as shown in Figure 5.9.

Figure 5.9 Next, the vectors are placed head to tail.

(3) Draw the resultant vector R from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector, as shown in Figure 5.10.

Figure 5.10 The resultant vector is drawn .

(4) Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of R, remembering to convert back to the units of meters using the scale. Use a
protractor to measure the direction of R. While the direction of the vector can be specified in many ways, the easiest way is to
measure the angle between the vector and the nearest horizontal or vertical axis. Since R is south of the eastward pointing axis
(the x-axis), we flip the protractor upside down and measure the angle between the eastward axis and the vector, as illustrated in
Figure 5.11.

Figure 5.11 A ruler is used to measure the magnitude of R, and a protractor is used to measure the direction of R.

In this case, the total displacement R has a magnitude of 50 m and points
this vector can be expressed as

south of east. Using its magnitude and direction,

Discussion
The head-to-tail graphical method of vector addition works for any number of vectors. It is also important to note that it does
not matter in what order the vectors are added. Changing the order does not change the resultant. For example, we could add
the vectors as shown in Figure 5.12, and we would still get the same solution.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Subtracting Vectors Graphically: A Woman Sailing a Boat

A woman sailing a boat at night is following directions to a dock. The instructions read to first sail 27.5 m in a direction
north of east from her current location, and then travel 30.0 m in a direction
north of east (or
west of north). If the
woman makes a mistake and travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the trip, where will she end up? The two legs
of the woman’s trip are illustrated in Figure 5.13.

Figure 5.13

In the diagram, the first leg of the trip is represented by vector A and the second leg is represented by vector B.

Strategy
We can represent the first leg of the trip with a vector A, and the second leg of the trip that she was supposed to take with a
vector B. Since the woman mistakenly travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the journey, the vector for second leg
of the trip she actually takes is −B. Therefore, she will end up at a location A + (−B), or A − B. Note that −B has the same
magnitude as B (30.0 m), but is in the opposite direction,
south of east, as illustrated in Figure 5.14.

Figure 5.14

Vector –B represents traveling in the opposite direction of vector B.

We use graphical vector addition to find where the woman arrives A + (−B).

Because subtraction of a vector is the same as addition of the same vector with the opposite direction, the graphical method for

WORKED EXAMPLE
Adding Velocities: A Boat on a River

A boat attempts to travel straight across a river at a speed of 3.8 m/s. The river current flows at a speed vriver of 6.1 m/s to the
right. What is the total velocity and direction of the boat? You can represent each meter per second of velocity as one centimeter
of vector length in your drawing.
Strategy
We start by choosing a coordinate system with its x-axis parallel to the velocity of the river. Because the boat is directed straight
toward the other shore, its velocity is perpendicular to the velocity of the river. We draw the two vectors, vboat and vriver, as
shown in Figure 5.16.
Using the head-to-tail method, we draw the resulting total velocity vector from the tail of vboat to the head of vriver.

By using a protractor to measure the angle, we find
Discussion
If the velocity of the boat and river were equal, then the direction of the total velocity would have been 45°. However, since the
velocity of the river is greater than that of the boat, the direction is less than 45° with respect to the shore, or x axis.

Components of Vectors
For the analytical method of vector addition and subtraction, we use some simple geometry and trigonometry, instead of using
a ruler and protractor as we did for graphical methods. However, the graphical method will still come in handy to visualize the
problem by drawing vectors using the head-to-tail method. The analytical method is more accurate than the graphical method,
which is limited by the precision of the drawing. For a refresher on the definitions of the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle,

Atmospheric Science

Figure 5.26 This picture shows Bert Foord during a television Weather Forecast from the Meteorological Office in 1963. (BBC TV)

Atmospheric science is a physical science, meaning that it is a science based heavily on physics. Atmospheric science includes
meteorology (the study of weather) and climatology (the study of climate). Climate is basically the average weather over a longer
time scale. Weather changes quickly over time, whereas the climate changes more gradually.
The movement of air, water and heat is vitally important to climatology and meteorology. Since motion is such a major factor in
weather and climate, this field uses vectors for much of its math.
Vectors are used to represent currents in the ocean, wind velocity and forces acting on a parcel of air. You have probably seen a
weather map using vectors to show the strength (magnitude) and direction of the wind.
Vectors used in atmospheric science are often three-dimensional. We won’t cover three-dimensional motion in this text, but to
go from two-dimensions to three-dimensions, you simply add a third vector component. Three-dimensional motion is
represented as a combination of x-, y- and z components, where z is the altitude.
Vector calculus combines vector math with calculus, and is often used to find the rates of change in temperature, pressure or
wind speed over time or distance. This is useful information, since atmospheric motion is driven by changes in pressure or
temperature. The greater the variation in pressure over a given distance, the stronger the wind to try to correct that imbalance.
Cold air tends to be more dense and therefore has higher pressure than warm air. Higher pressure air rushes into a region of
lower pressure and gets deflected by the spinning of the Earth, and friction slows the wind at Earth’s surface.
Finding how wind changes over distance and multiplying vectors lets meteorologists, like the one shown in Figure 5.26, figure
out how much rotation (spin) there is in the atmosphere at any given time and location. This is an important tool for tornado
prediction. Conditions with greater rotation are more likely to produce tornadoes.
GRASP CHECK
Why are vectors used so frequently in atmospheric science?
a. Vectors have magnitude as well as direction and can be quickly solved through scalar algebraic operations.
b. Vectors have magnitude but no direction, so it becomes easy to express physical quantities involved in the atmospheric
science.
c. Vectors can be solved very accurately through geometry, which helps to make better predictions in atmospheric science.

Properties of Projectile Motion
Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown (projected) into the air. After the initial force that launches the object, it only
experiences the force of gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory. As an object travels through
the air, it encounters a frictional force that slows its motion called air resistance. Air resistance does significantly alter trajectory
motion, but due to the difficulty in calculation, it is ignored in introductory physics.
The most important concept in projectile motion is that horizontal and vertical motions are independent, meaning that they
don’t influence one another. Figure 5.27 compares a cannonball in free fall (in blue) to a cannonball launched horizontally in
projectile motion (in red). You can see that the cannonball in free fall falls at the same rate as the cannonball in projectile motion.
Keep in mind that if the cannon launched the ball with any vertical component to the velocity, the vertical displacements would
not line up perfectly.

5.3 • Projectile Motion

Since vertical and horizontal motions are independent, we can analyze them separately, along perpendicular axes. To do this, we
separate projectile motion into the two components of its motion, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical.

Figure 5.27 The diagram shows the projectile motion of a cannonball shot at a horizontal angle versus one dropped with no horizontal
velocity. Note that both cannonballs have the same vertical position over time.

We’ll call the horizontal axis the x-axis and the vertical axis the y-axis. For notation, d is the total displacement, and x and y are
its components along the horizontal and vertical axes. The magnitudes of these vectors are x and y, as illustrated in Figure 5.28.

Figure 5.28 A boy kicks a ball at angle θ, and it is displaced a distance of s along its trajectory.

As usual, we use velocity, acceleration, and displacement to describe motion. We must also find the components of these
variables along the x- and y-axes. The components of acceleration are then very simple ay = –g = –9.80 m/s2. Note that this
definition defines the upwards direction as positive. Because gravity is vertical, ax = 0. Both accelerations are constant, so we
can use the kinematic equations. For review, the kinematic equations from a previous chapter are summarized in Table 5.1.

Static Friction and Kinetic Friction
Recall from the previous chapter that friction is a force that opposes motion, and is around us all the time. Friction allows us to
move, which you have discovered if you have ever tried to walk on ice.
There are different types of friction—kinetic and static. Kinetic friction acts on an object in motion, while static friction acts on
an object or system at rest. The maximum static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between the objects.
Imagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floor. You may push harder and harder on the crate and not
move it at all. This means that the static friction responds to what you do—it increases to be equal to and in the opposite
direction of your push. But if you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Once in motion,
it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to get it started because the kinetic friction force is less than the static friction force.
If you were to add mass to the crate, (for example, by placing a box on top of it) you would need to push even harder to get it
started and also to keep it moving. If, on the other hand, you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the crate started
and keep it going.
Figure 5.33 shows how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Magnifying these surfaces shows that they are rough
on the microscopic level. So when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object until it can
skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, break off the points, or do both. The harder the surfaces are pushed together
(such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them.

Chapter 5 • Motion in Two Dimensions

Figure 5.33 Frictional forces, such as f, always oppose motion or attempted motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part
because of the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view.

The magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static friction, the other for kinetic friction. When there is no
motion between the objects, the magnitude of static friction fs is

force of gravity and acts perpendicular to the surface in this example, but not always.
Since the symbol

means less than or equal to, this equation says that static friction can have a maximum value of

That is,

Static friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is exerted, up to its maximum limit.
Once the applied force exceeds fs(max), the object will move. Once an object is moving, the magnitude of kinetic friction fk is

Friction varies from surface to surface because different substances are rougher than others. Table 5.2 compares values of static
and kinetic friction for different surfaces. The coefficient of the friction depends on the two surfaces that are in contact.

Table 5.2 Coefficients of Static and Kinetic Friction
Since the direction of friction is always opposite to the direction of motion, friction runs parallel to the surface between objects
and perpendicular to the normal force. For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the floor) has a mass of
100 kg, then the normal force would be equal to its weight

perpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel to the floor greater
than

to move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of
only 290 N

would keep it moving at a constant speed. If the floor were lubricated, both coefficients would be much smaller than they would
be without lubrication. The coefficient of friction is unitless and is a number usually between 0 and 1.0.

Working with Inclined Planes
We discussed previously that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, there is a normal force supporting it equal in
magnitude to its weight. Up until now, we dealt only with normal force in one dimension, with gravity and normal force acting
perpendicular to the surface in opposing directions (gravity downward, and normal force upward). Now that you have the skills
to work with forces in two dimensions, we can explore what happens to weight and the normal force on a tilted surface such as
an inclined plane. For inclined plane problems, it is easier breaking down the forces into their components if we rotate the
coordinate system, as illustrated in Figure 5.34. The first step when setting up the problem is to break down the force of weight
into components.

Figure 5.34 The diagram shows perpendicular and horizontal components of weight on an inclined plane.

When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle with the horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object is divided
into two components: A force acting perpendicular to the plane,
, and a force acting parallel to the plane,
. The
perpendicular force of weight,
, is typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the normal force,
The force
acting parallel to the plane,
, causes the object to accelerate down the incline. The force of friction, , opposes the motion of
the object, so it acts upward along the plane.

It is important to be careful when resolving the weight of the object into components. If the angle of the incline is at an angle
to the horizontal, then the magnitudes of the weight components are

Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to determine them from reason. To do this, draw the right
triangle formed by the three weight vectors. Notice that the angle of the incline is the same as the angle formed between and

When the surface is flat, you could say that one of the components of the gravitational force is zero; Which one? As the angle
of the incline gets larger, what happens to the magnitudes of the perpendicular and parallel components of gravitational

a. When the angle is zero, the parallel component is zero and the perpendicular component is at a maximum. As the angle

The magnitude of kinetic friction was given as 45.0 N. Kinetic friction is related to the normal force N as
we can find the coefficient of kinetic friction by first finding the normal force of the skier on a slope. The normal force is always
perpendicular to the surface, and since there is no motion perpendicular to the surface, the normal force should equal the

Hooke’s Law and Simple Harmonic Motion
Imagine a car parked against a wall. If a bulldozer pushes the car into the wall, the car will not move but it will noticeably change
shape. A change in shape due to the application of a force is a deformation. Even very small forces are known to cause some
deformation. For small deformations, two important things can happen. First, unlike the car and bulldozer example, the object
returns to its original shape when the force is removed. Second, the size of the deformation is proportional to the force. This

5.5 • Simple Harmonic Motion

second property is known as Hooke’s law. In equation form, Hooke’s law is

where x is the amount of deformation (the change in length, for example) produced by the restoring force F, and k is a constant
that depends on the shape and composition of the object. The restoring force is the force that brings the object back to its
equilibrium position; the minus sign is there because the restoring force acts in the direction opposite to the displacement. Note
that the restoring force is proportional to the deformation x. The deformation can also be thought of as a displacement from
equilibrium. It is a change in position due to a force. In the absence of force, the object would rest at its equilibrium position.
The force constant k is related to the stiffness of a system. The larger the force constant, the stiffer the system. A stiffer system is
more difficult to deform and requires a greater restoring force. The units of k are newtons per meter (N/m). One of the most
common uses of Hooke’s law is solving problems involving springs and pendulums, which we will cover at the end of this
section.

Oscillations and Periodic Motion
What do an ocean buoy, a child in a swing, a guitar, and the beating of hearts all have in common? They all oscillate. That is, they
move back and forth between two points, like the ruler illustrated in Figure 5.37. All oscillations involve force. For example, you
push a child in a swing to get the motion started.

Figure 5.37 A ruler is displaced from its equilibrium position.

Newton’s first law implies that an object oscillating back and forth is experiencing forces. Without force, the object would move
in a straight line at a constant speed rather than oscillate. Consider, for example, plucking a plastic ruler to the left as shown in
Figure 5.38. The deformation of the ruler creates a force in the opposite direction, known as a restoring force. Once released, the
restoring force causes the ruler to move back toward its stable equilibrium position, where the net force on it is zero. However,
by the time the ruler gets there, it gains momentum and continues to move to the right, producing the opposite deformation. It
is then forced to the left, back through equilibrium, and the process is repeated until it gradually loses all of its energy. The
simplest oscillations occur when the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement. Recall that Hooke’s law describes
this situation with the equation F = −kx. Therefore, Hooke’s law describes and applies to the simplest case of oscillation, known
as simple harmonic motion.

Figure 5.38 (a) The plastic ruler has been released, and the restoring force is returning the ruler to its equilibrium position. (b) The net force
is zero at the equilibrium position, but the ruler has momentum and continues to move to the right. (c) The restoring force is in the opposite
direction. It stops the ruler and moves it back toward equilibrium again. (d) Now the ruler has momentum to the left. (e) In the absence of
damping (caused by frictional forces), the ruler reaches its original position. From there, the motion will repeat itself.

Chapter 5 • Motion in Two Dimensions

When you pluck a guitar string, the resulting sound has a steady tone and lasts a long time. Each vibration of the string takes
the same time as the previous one. Periodic motion is a motion that repeats itself at regular time intervals, such as with an
object bobbing up and down on a spring or a pendulum swinging back and forth. The time to complete one oscillation (a
complete cycle of motion) remains constant and is called the period T. Its units are usually seconds.
Frequency f is the number of oscillations per unit time. The SI unit for frequency is the hertz (Hz), defined as the number of
oscillations per second. The relationship between frequency and period is

As you can see from the equation, frequency and period are different ways of expressing the same concept. For example, if you
get a paycheck twice a month, you could say that the frequency of payment is two per month, or that the period between checks
is half a month.
If there is no friction to slow it down, then an object in simple motion will oscillate forever with equal displacement on either
side of the equilibrium position. The equilibrium position is where the object would naturally rest in the absence of force. The
maximum displacement from equilibrium is called the amplitude X. The units for amplitude and displacement are the same,
but depend on the type of oscillation. For the object on the spring, shown in Figure 5.39, the units of amplitude and
displacement are meters.

Figure 5.39 An object attached to a spring sliding on a frictionless surface is a simple harmonic oscillator. When displaced from equilibrium,
the object performs simple harmonic motion that has an amplitude X and a period T. The object’s maximum speed occurs as it passes
through equilibrium. The stiffer the spring is, the smaller the period T. The greater the mass of the object is, the greater the period T.

The mass m and the force constant k are the only factors that affect the period and frequency of simple harmonic motion. The
period of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by

Solving Spring and Pendulum Problems with Simple Harmonic Motion
Before solving problems with springs and pendulums, it is important to first get an understanding of how a pendulum works.
Figure 5.40 provides a useful illustration of a simple pendulum.

Figure 5.40 A simple pendulum has a small-diameter bob and a string that has a very small mass but is strong enough not to stretch. The
linear displacement from equilibrium is s, the length of the arc. Also shown are the forces on the bob, which result in a net force of −mg sinθ
toward the equilibrium position—that is, a restoring force.

Everyday examples of pendulums include old-fashioned clocks, a child’s swing, or the sinker on a fishing line. For small
displacements of less than 15 degrees, a pendulum experiences simple harmonic oscillation, meaning that its restoring force is
directly proportional to its displacement. A pendulum in simple harmonic motion is called a simple pendulum. A pendulum has
an object with a small mass, also known as the pendulum bob, which hangs from a light wire or string. The equilibrium position
for a pendulum is where the angle is zero (that is, when the pendulum is hanging straight down). It makes sense that without
any force applied, this is where the pendulum bob would rest.
The displacement of the pendulum bob is the arc length s. The weight mg has components mg cos along the string and mg sin
tangent to the arc. Tension in the string exactly cancels the component mg cos parallel to the string. This leaves a net
restoring force back toward the equilibrium position that runs tangent to the arc and equals −mg sin .

For a simple pendulum, The period is
The only things that affect the period of a simple pendulum are its length and the acceleration due to gravity. The period is
completely independent of other factors, such as mass or amplitude. However, note that T does depend on g. This means that if
we know the length of a pendulum, we can actually use it to measure gravity! This will come in useful in Figure 5.40.

Strategy
Consider the car to be in its equilibrium position x = 0 before the person gets in. The car then settles down 1.20 cm, which means
it is displaced to a position x = −1.20×10−2 m.
At that point, the springs supply a restoring force F equal to the person’s weight
w = mg = (80.0 kg)(9.80 m/s2) = 784 N. We take this force to be F in Hooke’s law.
Knowing F and x, we can then solve for the force constant k.
Solution
Solve Hooke’s law, F = −kx, for k.

Substitute known values and solve for k.

Discussion
Note that F and x have opposite signs because they are in opposite directions—the restoring force is up, and the displacement is
down. Also, note that the car would oscillate up and down when the person got in, if it were not for the shock absorbers.
Bouncing cars are a sure sign of bad shock absorbers.

direction of are then determined with a ruler and
protractor.
• The graphical method of subtracting vectors A and B
involves adding the opposite of vector B, which is
defined as −B. In this case,
Next, use the head-totail method as for vector addition to obtain the resultant
vector .
• Addition of vectors is independent of the order in which
they are added; A + B = B + A.
• The head-to-tail method of adding vectors involves

drawing the first vector on a graph and then placing the
tail of each subsequent vector at the head of the
previous vector. The resultant vector is then drawn from
the tail of the first vector to the head of the final vector.
• Variables in physics problems, such as force or velocity,
can be represented with vectors by making the length of
the vector proportional to the magnitude of the force or
velocity.
• Problems involving displacement, force, or velocity may
be solved graphically by measuring the resultant
vector’s magnitude with a ruler and measuring the
direction with a protractor.

5.2 Vector Addition and
Subtraction: Analytical Methods
• The analytical method of vector addition and
subtraction uses the Pythagorean theorem and
trigonometric identities to determine the magnitude

and direction of a resultant vector.
• The steps to add vectors and using the analytical
method are as follows:
1. Determine the coordinate system for the vectors. Then,
determine the horizontal and vertical components of
each vector using the equations

and

2. Add the horizontal and vertical components of each
vector to determine the components
and
of the
resultant vector,
and

3. Use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the
magnitude, , of the resultant vector

• To solve projectile problems: choose a coordinate
system; analyze the motion in the vertical and
horizontal direction separately; then, recombine the
horizontal and vertical components using vector
addition equations.

5.4 Inclined Planes
• Friction is a contact force between systems that opposes
the motion or attempted motion between them. Simple
friction is proportional to the normal force N pushing
the systems together. A normal force is always
perpendicular to the contact surface between systems.
Friction depends on both of the materials involved.
• µs is the coefficient of static friction, which depends on
both of the materials.
• µk is the coefficient of kinetic friction, which also
depends on both materials.
• When objects rest on an inclined plane that makes an
angle with the horizontal surface, the weight of the
object can be broken into components that act
and parallel (
) to the surface of
perpendicular
the plane.

5.3 Projectile Motion
• Projectile motion is the motion of an object through the
air that is subject only to the acceleration of gravity.
• Projectile motion in the horizontal and vertical
directions are independent of one another.
• The maximum height of an projectile is the highest
altitude, or maximum displacement in the vertical
position reached in the path of a projectile.
• The range is the maximum horizontal distance traveled
by a projectile.

• An oscillation is a back and forth motion of an object
between two points of deformation.
• An oscillation may create a wave, which is a disturbance
that propagates from where it was created.
• The simplest type of oscillations are related to systems
that can be described by Hooke’s law.
• Periodic motion is a repetitious oscillation.
• The time for one oscillation is the period T.
• The number of oscillations per unit time is the
frequency
• A mass m suspended by a wire of length L is a simple
pendulum and undergoes simple harmonic motion for
amplitudes less than about 15 degrees.

INTRODUCTION You may recall learning about various aspects of motion along a straight line: kinematics (where we learned
about displacement, velocity, and acceleration), projectile motion (a special case of two-dimensional kinematics), force, and
Newton’s laws of motion. In some ways, this chapter is a continuation of Newton’s laws of motion. Recall that Newton’s first law
tells us that objects move along a straight line at constant speed unless a net external force acts on them. Therefore, if an object
moves along a circular path, such as the car in the photo, it must be experiencing an external force. In this chapter, we explore
both circular motion and rotational motion.

Angle of Rotation
What exactly do we mean by circular motion or rotation? Rotational motion is the circular motion of an object about an axis of
rotation. We will discuss specifically circular motion and spin. Circular motion is when an object moves in a circular path.
Examples of circular motion include a race car speeding around a circular curve, a toy attached to a string swinging in a circle
around your head, or the circular loop-the-loop on a roller coaster. Spin is rotation about an axis that goes through the center of
mass of the object, such as Earth rotating on its axis, a wheel turning on its axle, the spin of a tornado on its path of destruction,
or a figure skater spinning during a performance at the Olympics. Sometimes, objects will be spinning while in circular motion,
like the Earth spinning on its axis while revolving around the Sun, but we will focus on these two motions separately.
When solving problems involving rotational motion, we use variables that are similar to linear variables (distance, velocity,
acceleration, and force) but take into account the curvature or rotation of the motion. Here, we define the angle of rotation,
which is the angular equivalence of distance; and angular velocity, which is the angular equivalence of linear velocity.
When objects rotate about some axis—for example, when the CD in Figure 6.2 rotates about its center—each point in the object
follows a circular path.

Figure 6.2 All points on a CD travel in circular paths. The pits (dots) along a line from the center to the edge all move through the same
angle

The arc length, , is the distance traveled along a circular path. The radius of curvature, r, is the radius of the circular path. Both

Consider a line from the center of the CD to its edge. In a given time, each pit (used to record information) on this line moves
through the same angle. The angle of rotation is the amount of rotation and is the angular analog of distance. The angle of
is the arc length divided by the radius of curvature.
rotation

The angle of rotation is often measured by using a unit called the radian. (Radians are actually dimensionless, because a radian
is defined as the ratio of two distances, radius and arc length.) A revolution is one complete rotation, where every point on the
radians (or 360 degrees), and therefore has an angle of rotation

of
radians, and an arc length that is the same as the circumference of the circle. We can convert between radians,
revolutions, and degrees using the relationship
1 revolution =

rad = 360°. See Table 6.1 for the conversion of degrees to radians for some common angles.

Angular Velocity
How fast is an object rotating? We can answer this question by using the concept of angular velocity. Consider first the angular
speed
is the rate at which the angle of rotation changes. In equation form, the angular speed is
6.2
which means that an angular rotation
occurs in a time,
. If an object rotates through a greater angle of rotation in a
given time, it has a greater angular speed. The units for angular speed are radians per second (rad/s).
Now let’s consider the direction of the angular speed, which means we now must call it the angular velocity. The direction of the

199

200

Chapter 6 • Circular and Rotational Motion

angular velocity is along the axis of rotation. For an object rotating clockwise, the angular velocity points away from you along
the axis of rotation. For an object rotating counterclockwise, the angular velocity points toward you along the axis of rotation.
Angular velocity (ω) is the angular version of linear velocity v. Tangential velocity is the instantaneous linear velocity of an
object in rotational motion. To get the precise relationship between angular velocity and tangential velocity, consider again a pit
on the rotating CD. This pit moves through an arc length
in a short time
so its tangential speed is
6.3
From the definition of the angle of rotation,

, we see that

. Substituting this into the expression for v gives

The equation
says that the tangential speed v is proportional to the distance r from the center of rotation. Consequently,
tangential speed is greater for a point on the outer edge of the CD (with larger r) than for a point closer to the center of the CD
(with smaller r). This makes sense because a point farther out from the center has to cover a longer arc length in the same
amount of time as a point closer to the center. Note that both points will still have the same angular speed, regardless of their
distance from the center of rotation. See Figure 6.4.

Figure 6.4 Points 1 and 2 rotate through the same angle (

), but point 2 moves through a greater arc length (

) because it is farther

from the center of rotation.

Now, consider another example: the tire of a moving car (see Figure 6.5). The faster the tire spins, the faster the car moves—large
means large v because
. Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity, , will produce a greater
linear (tangential) velocity, v, for the car. This is because a larger radius means a longer arc length must contact the road, so the
car must move farther in the same amount of time.

6.1 • Angle of Rotation and Angular Velocity

Figure 6.5 A car moving at a velocity, v, to the right has a tire rotating with angular velocity

. The speed of the tread of the tire relative to

the axle is v, the same as if the car were jacked up and the wheels spinning without touching the road. Directly below the axle, where the
tire touches the road, the tire tread moves backward with respect to the axle with tangential velocity

, where r is the tire radius.

Because the road is stationary with respect to this point of the tire, the car must move forward at the linear velocity v. A larger angular
velocity for the tire means a greater linear velocity for the car.

However, there are cases where linear velocity and tangential velocity are not equivalent, such as a car spinning its tires on ice.
In this case, the linear velocity will be less than the tangential velocity. Due to the lack of friction under the tires of a car on ice,
the arc length through which the tire treads move is greater than the linear distance through which the car moves. It’s similar to
running on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike; you are literally going nowhere fast.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Angular velocity ω and tangential velocity v are vectors, so we must include magnitude and direction. The direction of the
angular velocity is along the axis of rotation, and points away from you for an object rotating clockwise, and toward you for
an object rotating counterclockwise. In mathematics this is described by the right-hand rule. Tangential velocity is usually
described as up, down, left, right, north, south, east, or west, as shown in Figure 6.6.

Figure 6.6 As the fly on the edge of an old-fashioned vinyl record moves in a circle, its instantaneous velocity is always at a tangent to
the circle. The direction of the angular velocity is into the page this case.

We were able to drop the radians from the final solution to part (b) because radians are actually dimensionless. This is because
the radian is defined as the ratio of two distances (radius and arc length). Thus, the formula gives an answer in units of meters,
as expected for an arc length.

When we cancel units in the above calculation, we get 50.0/s (i.e., 50.0 per second, which is usually written as 50.0 s−1). But the

speed because we know that the motion is circular. Also note that, if an earth mover with much larger tires, say 1.20 m in radius,

Centripetal Acceleration
In the previous section, we defined circular motion. The simplest case of circular motion is uniform circular motion, where an
object travels a circular path at a constant speed. Note that, unlike speed, the linear velocity of an object in circular motion is
constantly changing because it is always changing direction. We know from kinematics that acceleration is a change in velocity,
either in magnitude or in direction or both. Therefore, an object undergoing uniform circular motion is always accelerating,
even though the magnitude of its velocity is constant.
You experience this acceleration yourself every time you ride in a car while it turns a corner. If you hold the steering wheel steady
during the turn and move at a constant speed, you are executing uniform circular motion. What you notice is a feeling of sliding
(or being flung, depending on the speed) away from the center of the turn. This isn’t an actual force that is acting on you—it only
happens because your body wants to continue moving in a straight line (as per Newton’s first law) whereas the car is turning off
this straight-line path. Inside the car it appears as if you are forced away from the center of the turn. This fictitious force is
known as the centrifugal force. The sharper the curve and the greater your speed, the more noticeable this effect becomes.
Figure 6.7 shows an object moving in a circular path at constant speed. The direction of the instantaneous tangential velocity is
shown at two points along the path. Acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity; in this case it points roughly toward
the center of rotation. (The center of rotation is at the center of the circular path). If we imagine
becoming smaller and
smaller, then the acceleration would point exactly toward the center of rotation, but this case is hard to draw. We call the
acceleration of an object moving in uniform circular motion the centripetal acceleration ac because centripetal means center
seeking.

206

Chapter 6 • Circular and Rotational Motion

Figure 6.7 The directions of the velocity of an object at two different points are shown, and the change in velocity
approximately toward the center of curvature (see small inset). For an extremely small value of
the circle (but this is hard to draw). Because

,

is seen to point

, the acceleration is also toward the center, so ac is called centripetal acceleration.

Now that we know that the direction of centripetal acceleration is toward the center of rotation, let’s discuss the magnitude of
centripetal acceleration. For an object traveling at speed v in a circular path with radius r, the magnitude of centripetal
acceleration is

Centripetal acceleration is greater at high speeds and in sharp curves (smaller radius), as you may have noticed when driving a
car, because the car actually pushes you toward the center of the turn. But it is a bit surprising that ac is proportional to the
speed squared. This means, for example, that the acceleration is four times greater when you take a curve at 100 km/h than at 50
km/h.
We can also express ac in terms of the magnitude of angular velocity. Substituting

into the equation above, we get

. Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal acceleration in terms of the magnitude of angular velocity is
6.9

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

The equation expressed in the form ac = rω2 is useful for solving problems where you know the angular velocity rather than
the tangential velocity.

In uniform circular motion, what is the angle between the acceleration and the velocity? What type of acceleration does a
body experience in the uniform circular motion?
a. The angle between acceleration and velocity is 0°, and the body experiences linear acceleration.
b. The angle between acceleration and velocity is 0°, and the body experiences centripetal acceleration.
c. The angle between acceleration and velocity is 90°, and the body experiences linear acceleration.
d. The angle between acceleration and velocity is 90°, and the body experiences centripetal acceleration.

Centripetal Force
Because an object in uniform circular motion undergoes constant acceleration (by changing direction), we know from Newton’s
second law of motion that there must be a constant net external force acting on the object.
Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal acceleration. Just a few examples are the tension in the rope on a
tether ball, the force of Earth’s gravity on the Moon, the friction between a road and the tires of a car as it goes around a curve, or
the normal force of a roller coaster track on the cart during a loop-the-loop.
Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a centripetal force. The direction of a centripetal force is toward the
center of rotation, the same as for centripetal acceleration. According to Newton’s second law of motion, a net force causes the
acceleration of mass according to Fnet = ma. For uniform circular motion, the acceleration is centripetal acceleration: a = ac.
Therefore, the magnitude of centripetal force, Fc, is
.
By using the two different forms of the equation for the magnitude of centripetal acceleration,
and
, we
get two expressions involving the magnitude of the centripetal force Fc. The first expression is in terms of tangential speed, the
second is in terms of angular speed:

and

.

Both forms of the equation depend on mass, velocity, and the radius of the circular path. You may use whichever expression for
centripetal force is more convenient. Newton’s second law also states that the object will accelerate in the same direction as the
net force. By definition, the centripetal force is directed towards the center of rotation, so the object will also accelerate towards
the center. A straight line drawn from the circular path to the center of the circle will always be perpendicular to the tangential
velocity. Note that, if you solve the first expression for r, you get

From this expression, we see that, for a given mass and velocity, a large centripetal force causes a small radius of
curvature—that is, a tight curve.

Rotational Kinematics
In the section on uniform circular motion, we discussed motion in a circle at constant speed and, therefore, constant angular
velocity. However, there are times when angular velocity is not constant—rotational motion can speed up, slow down, or reverse
directions. Angular velocity is not constant when a spinning skater pulls in her arms, when a child pushes a merry-go-round to
make it rotate, or when a CD slows to a halt when switched off. In all these cases, angular acceleration occurs because the
angular velocity changes. The faster the change occurs, the greater is the angular acceleration. Angular acceleration is the
rate of change of angular velocity. In equation form, angular acceleration is

where
is the change in angular velocity and
is the change in time. The units of angular acceleration are (rad/s)/s, or rad/
s2. If increases, then is positive. If decreases, then is negative. Keep in mind that, by convention, counterclockwise is
the positive direction and clockwise is the negative direction. For example, the skater in Figure 6.9 is rotating counterclockwise
as seen from above, so her angular velocity is positive. Acceleration would be negative, for example, when an object that is
rotating counterclockwise slows down. It would be positive when an object that is rotating counterclockwise speeds up.

The relationship between the magnitudes of tangential acceleration, a, and angular acceleration,

These equations mean that the magnitudes of tangential acceleration and angular acceleration are directly proportional to each
other. The greater the angular acceleration, the larger the change in tangential acceleration, and vice versa. For example,
consider riders in their pods on a Ferris wheel at rest. A Ferris wheel with greater angular acceleration will give the riders
greater tangential acceleration because, as the Ferris wheel increases its rate of spinning, it also increases its tangential velocity.
Note that the radius of the spinning object also matters. For example, for a given angular acceleration , a smaller Ferris wheel
leads to a smaller tangential acceleration for the riders.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Tangential acceleration is sometimes denoted at. It is a linear acceleration in a direction tangent to the circle at the point of
interest in circular or rotational motion. Remember that tangential acceleration is parallel to the tangential velocity (either in
the same direction or in the opposite direction.) Centripetal acceleration is always perpendicular to the tangential velocity.
So far, we have defined three rotational variables: ,

Table 6.2 Rotational and Linear Variables
We can now begin to see how rotational quantities like , , and are related to each other. For example, if a motorcycle wheel
that starts at rest has a large angular acceleration for a fairly long time, it ends up spinning rapidly and rotates through many
revolutions. Putting this in terms of the variables, if the wheel’s angular acceleration is large for a long period of time t, then
the final angular velocity and angle of rotation are large. In the case of linear motion, if an object starts at rest and
undergoes a large linear acceleration, then it has a large final velocity and will have traveled a large distance.
The kinematics of rotational motion describes the relationships between the angle of rotation, angular velocity, angular
acceleration, and time. It only describes motion—it does not include any forces or masses that may affect rotation (these are

FUN IN PHYSICS
Storm Chasing

Figure 6.10 Tornadoes descend from clouds in funnel-like shapes that spin violently. (Daphne Zaras, U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration)

Storm chasers tend to fall into one of three groups: Amateurs chasing tornadoes as a hobby, atmospheric scientists gathering
data for research, weather watchers for news media, or scientists having fun under the guise of work. Storm chasing is a
dangerous pastime because tornadoes can change course rapidly with little warning. Since storm chasers follow in the wake of
the destruction left by tornadoes, changing flat tires due to debris left on the highway is common. The most active part of the
world for tornadoes, called tornado alley, is in the central United States, between the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian
Mountains.
Tornadoes are perfect examples of rotational motion in action in nature. They come out of severe thunderstorms called
supercells, which have a column of air rotating around a horizontal axis, usually about four miles across. The difference in wind
speeds between the strong cold winds higher up in the atmosphere in the jet stream and weaker winds traveling north from the
Gulf of Mexico causes the column of rotating air to shift so that it spins around a vertical axis, creating a tornado.
Tornadoes produce wind speeds as high as 500 km/h (approximately 300 miles/h), particularly at the bottom where the funnel is
narrowest because the rate of rotation increases as the radius decreases. They blow houses away as if they were made of paper
and have been known to pierce tree trunks with pieces of straw.
GRASP CHECK
What is the physics term for the eye of the storm? Why would winds be weaker at the eye of the tornado than at its outermost
edge?
a. The eye of the storm is the center of rotation. Winds are weaker at the eye of a tornado because tangential velocity is
directly proportional to radius of curvature.
b. The eye of the storm is the center of rotation. Winds are weaker at the eye of a tornado because tangential velocity is
inversely proportional to radius of curvature.
c. The eye of the storm is the center of rotation. Winds are weaker at the eye of a tornado because tangential velocity is
directly proportional to the square of the radius of curvature.
d. The eye of the storm is the center of rotation. Winds are weaker at the eye of a tornado because tangential velocity is
inversely proportional to the square of the radius of curvature.

Torque
If you have ever spun a bike wheel or pushed a merry-go-round, you know that force is needed to change angular velocity. The
farther the force is applied from the pivot point (or fulcrum), the greater the angular acceleration. For example, a door opens
slowly if you push too close to its hinge, but opens easily if you push far from the hinges. Furthermore, we know that the more

215

216

Chapter 6 • Circular and Rotational Motion

massive the door is, the more slowly it opens; this is because angular acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. These
relationships are very similar to the relationships between force, mass, and acceleration from Newton’s second law of motion.
Since we have already covered the angular versions of distance, velocity and time, you may wonder what the angular version of
force is, and how it relates to linear force.
The angular version of force is torque , which is the turning effectiveness of a force. See Figure 6.11. The equation for the
magnitude of torque is

where r is the magnitude of the lever arm, F is the magnitude of the linear force, and is the angle between the lever arm and
the force. The lever arm is the vector from the point of rotation (pivot point or fulcrum) to the location where force is applied.
Since the magnitude of the lever arm is a distance, its units are in meters, and torque has units of N⋅m. Torque is a vector
quantity and has the same direction as the angular acceleration that it produces.

Figure 6.11 A man pushes a merry-go-round at its edge and perpendicular to the lever arm to achieve maximum torque.

Applying a stronger torque will produce a greater angular acceleration. For example, the harder the man pushes the merry-goround in Figure 6.11, the faster it accelerates. Furthermore, the more massive the merry-go-round is, the slower it accelerates for
the same torque. If the man wants to maximize the effect of his force on the merry-go-round, he should push as far from the
center as possible to get the largest lever arm and, therefore, the greatest torque and angular acceleration. Torque is also
maximized when the force is applied perpendicular to the lever arm.

Solving Rotational Kinematics and Torque Problems
Just as linear forces can balance to produce zero net force and no linear acceleration, the same is true of rotational motion.
When two torques of equal magnitude act in opposing directions, there is no net torque and no angular acceleration, as you can
see in the following video. If zero net torque acts on a system spinning at a constant angular velocity, the system will continue to
spin at the same angular velocity.

WATCH PHYSICS
Introduction to Torque

This video (https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/torque-angular-momentum/torque-tutorial/v/introduction-totorque) defines torque in terms of moment arm (which is the same as lever arm). It also covers a problem with forces acting in
opposing directions about a pivot point. (At this stage, you can ignore Sal’s references to work and mechanical advantage.)

acceleration? What would happen to the ruler over time?
a. The ruler is in a state of rotational equilibrium so it will not rotate about its center of mass. Thus, the angular
acceleration will be zero.
b. The ruler is not in a state of rotational equilibrium so it will not rotate about its center of mass. Thus, the angular
acceleration will be zero.
c. The ruler is not in a state of rotational equilibrium so it will rotate about its center of mass. Thus, the angular
acceleration will be non-zero.
d. The ruler is in a state of rotational equilibrium so it will rotate about its center of mass. Thus, the angular acceleration
will be non-zero.

Now let’s look at examples applying rotational kinematics to a fishing reel and the concept of torque to a merry-go-round.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating the Time for a Fishing Reel to Stop Spinning

A deep-sea fisherman uses a fishing rod with a reel of radius 4.50 cm. A big fish takes the bait and swims away from the boat,
pulling the fishing line from his fishing reel. As the fishing line unwinds from the reel, the reel spins at an angular velocity of 220
rad/s. The fisherman applies a brake to the spinning reel, creating an angular acceleration of −300 rad/s2. How long does it take
the reel to come to a stop?

We solve the equation algebraically for t, and then insert the known values.

6.12

Discussion
The time to stop the reel is fairly small because the acceleration is fairly large. Fishing lines sometimes snap because of the forces
involved, and fishermen often let the fish swim for a while before applying brakes on the reel. A tired fish will be slower,
requiring a smaller acceleration and therefore a smaller force.

INTRODUCTION What do a falling apple and the orbit of the moon have in common? You will learn in this chapter that each is
caused by gravitational force. The motion of all celestial objects, in fact, is determined by the gravitational force, which depends
on their mass and separation.
Johannes Kepler discovered three laws of planetary motion that all orbiting planets and moons follow. Years later, Isaac Newton
found these laws useful in developing his law of universal gravitation. This law relates gravitational force to the masses of objects
and the distance between them. Many years later still, Albert Einstein showed there was a little more to the gravitation story
when he published his theory of general relativity.

Concepts Related to Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
Examples of orbits abound. Hundreds of artificial satellites orbit Earth together with thousands of pieces of debris. The moon’s
orbit around Earth has intrigued humans from time immemorial. The orbits of planets, asteroids, meteors, and comets around
the sun are no less interesting. If we look farther, we see almost unimaginable numbers of stars, galaxies, and other celestial
objects orbiting one another and interacting through gravity.
All these motions are governed by gravitational force. The orbital motions of objects in our own solar system are simple enough
to describe with a few fairly simple laws. The orbits of planets and moons satisfy the following two conditions:
• The mass of the orbiting object, m, is small compared to the mass of the object it orbits, M.
• The system is isolated from other massive objects.
Based on the motion of the planets about the sun, Kepler devised a set of three classical laws, called Kepler’s laws of planetary
motion, that describe the orbits of all bodies satisfying these two conditions:
1. The orbit of each planet around the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus.
2. Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
3. The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets about the sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average
distances from the sun.
These descriptive laws are named for the German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630). He devised them after careful study
(over some 20 years) of a large amount of meticulously recorded observations of planetary motion done by Tycho Brahe
(1546–1601). Such careful collection and detailed recording of methods and data are hallmarks of good science. Data constitute
the evidence from which new interpretations and meanings can be constructed. Let’s look closer at each of these laws.

Kepler’s First Law
The orbit of each planet about the sun is an ellipse with the sun at one focus, as shown in Figure 7.2. The planet’s closest
approach to the sun is called aphelion and its farthest distance from the sun is called perihelion.

Access for free at openstax.org.

7.1 • Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

Figure 7.2 (a) An ellipse is a closed curve such that the sum of the distances from a point on the curve to the two foci (f1 and f2) is constant.
(b) For any closed orbit, m follows an elliptical path with M at one focus. (c) The aphelion (ra) is the closest distance between the planet and
the sun, while the perihelion (rp) is the farthest distance from the sun.

If you know the aphelion (ra) and perihelion (rp) distances, then you can calculate the semi-major axis (a) and semi-minor axis
(b).

tracing a line on the paper.

Chapter 7 • Newton's Law of Gravitation

Kepler’s Second Law
Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times, as shown
in Figure 7.4.

Figure 7.4 The shaded regions have equal areas. The time for m to go from A to B is the same as the time to go from C to D and from E to F.
The mass m moves fastest when it is closest to M. Kepler’s second law was originally devised for planets orbiting the sun, but it has broader
validity.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Note that while, for historical reasons, Kepler’s laws are stated for planets orbiting the sun, they are actually valid for all
bodies satisfying the two previously stated conditions.

Kepler’s Third Law
The ratio of the periods squared of any two planets around the sun is equal to the ratio of their average distances from the sun
cubed. In equation form, this is

where T is the period (time for one orbit) and r is the average distance (also called orbital radius). This equation is valid only for
comparing two small masses orbiting a single large mass. Most importantly, this is only a descriptive equation; it gives no
information about the cause of the equality.

LINKS TO PHYSICS
History: Ptolemy vs. Copernicus

Before the discoveries of Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and others, the solar system was thought to revolve around Earth
as shown in Figure 7.5 (a). This is called the Ptolemaic model, named for the Greek philosopher Ptolemy who lived in the second
century AD. The Ptolemaic model is characterized by a list of facts for the motions of planets, with no explanation of cause and
effect. There tended to be a different rule for each heavenly body and a general lack of simplicity.
Figure 7.5 (b) represents the modern or Copernican model. In this model, a small set of rules and a single underlying force
explain not only all planetary motion in the solar system, but also all other situations involving gravity. The breadth and
simplicity of the laws of physics are compelling.

7.1 • Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

Figure 7.5 (a) The Ptolemaic model of the universe has Earth at the center with the moon, the planets, the sun, and the stars revolving
about it in complex circular paths. This geocentric (Earth-centered) model, which can be made progressively more accurate by adding more
circles, is purely descriptive, containing no hints about the causes of these motions. (b) The Copernican heliocentric (sun-centered) model
is a simpler and more accurate model.

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) first had the idea that the planets circle the sun, in about 1514. It took him almost 20 years to
work out the mathematical details for his model. He waited another 10 years or so to publish his work. It is thought he hesitated
because he was afraid people would make fun of his theory. Actually, the reaction of many people was more one of fear and
anger. Many people felt the Copernican model threatened their basic belief system. About 100 years later, the astronomer Galileo
was put under house arrest for providing evidence that planets, including Earth, orbited the sun. In all, it took almost 300 years
for everyone to admit that Copernicus had been right all along.

the sun, moon, and other planets.

is a constant. The definition
Refer back to Figure 7.2 (a). Notice which distances are constant. The foci are fixed, so distance
of an ellipse states that the sum of the distances
is also constant. These two facts taken together mean that the
must also be constant. Knowledge of these constants will help you determine positions and
perimeter of triangle
distances of objects in a system that includes one object orbiting another.

Kepler’s Second Law
Refer back to Figure 7.4. The second law says that the segments have equal area and that it takes equal time to sweep through
each segment. That is, the time it takes to travel from A to B equals the time it takes to travel from C to D, and so forth. Velocity v
equals distance d divided by time t:
. Then,
, so distance divided by velocity is also a constant. For example, if we
know the average velocity of Earth on June 21 and December 21, we can compare the distance Earth travels on those days.
The degree of elongation of an elliptical orbit is called its eccentricity (e). Eccentricity is calculated by dividing the distance f
from the center of an ellipse to one of the foci by half the long axis a.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Kepler’s First Law

At its closest approach, a moon comes within 200,000 km of the planet it orbits. At that point, the moon is 300,000 km from the
other focus of its orbit, f2. The planet is focus f1 of the moon’s elliptical orbit. How far is the moon from the planet when it is
260,000 km from f2?
Strategy
Show and label the ellipse that is the orbit in your solution. Picture the triangle f1mf2 collapsed along the major axis and add up
the lengths of the three sides. Find the length of the unknown side of the triangle when the moon is 260,000 km from f2.
Solution
Perimeter of

Discussion
The perimeter of triangle f1mf2 must be constant because the distance between the foci does not change and Kepler’s first law
says the orbit is an ellipse. For any ellipse, the sum of the two sides of the triangle, which are f1m and mf2, is constant.

Figure 7.6 shows the major and minor axes of an ellipse. The semi-major and semi-minor axes are half of these, respectively.

Figure 7.6

The major axis is the length of the ellipse, and the minor axis is the width of the ellipse. The semi-major axis is half the major

axis, and the semi-minor axis is half the minor axis.

Earth’s orbit is slightly elliptical, with a semi-major axis of 152 million km and a semi-minor axis of 147 million km. If Earth’s
period is 365.26 days, what area does an Earth-to-sun line sweep past in one day?
Strategy
Each day, Earth sweeps past an equal-sized area, so we divide the total area by the number of days in a year to find the area
. Calculate A, the area inside Earth’s orbit and divide by the number of days in
swept past in one day. For total area use
a year (i.e., its period).
Solution

7.2

The area swept out in one day is thus

.

Discussion
The answer is based on Kepler’s law, which states that a line from a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

Kepler’s Third Law

Kepler’s third law states that the ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets (T1, T2) is equal to the ratio of the cubes of
their average orbital distance from the sun (r1, r2). Mathematically, this is represented by

From this equation, it follows that the ratio r3/T2 is the same for all planets in the solar system. Later we will see how the work of
Newton leads to a value for this constant.

This is a reasonable period for a satellite in a fairly low orbit. It is interesting that any satellite at this altitude will complete one
orbit in the same amount of time.

Newton’s universal law of gravitation

Concepts Related to Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to precisely define the gravitational force, and to show that it could explain both falling
bodies and astronomical motions. See Figure 7.7. But Newton was not the first to suspect that the same force caused both our
weight and the motion of planets. His forerunner, Galileo Galilei, had contended that falling bodies and planetary motions had
the same cause. Some of Newton’s contemporaries, such as Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, and Edmund Halley, had also
made some progress toward understanding gravitation. But Newton was the first to propose an exact mathematical form and to
use that form to show that the motion of heavenly bodies should be conic sections—circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas.
This theoretical prediction was a major triumph. It had been known for some time that moons, planets, and comets follow such
paths, but no one had been able to propose an explanation of the mechanism that caused them to follow these paths and not
others.

Figure 7.7 The popular legend that Newton suddenly discovered the law of universal gravitation when an apple fell from a tree and hit him
on the head has an element of truth in it. A more probable account is that he was walking through an orchard and wondered why all the
apples fell in the same direction with the same acceleration. Great importance is attached to it because Newton’s universal law of
gravitation and his laws of motion answered very old questions about nature and gave tremendous support to the notion of underlying
simplicity and unity in nature. Scientists still expect underlying simplicity to emerge from their ongoing inquiries into nature.

The gravitational force is relatively simple. It is always attractive, and it depends only on the masses involved and the distance

237

238

Chapter 7 • Newton's Law of Gravitation

between them. Expressed in modern language, Newton’s universal law of gravitation states that every object in the universe
attracts every other object with a force that is directed along a line joining them. The force is directly proportional to the product
of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This attraction is illustrated by Figure
7.8.

Figure 7.8 Gravitational attraction is along a line joining the centers of mass (CM) of the two bodies. The magnitude of the force on each
body is the same, consistent with Newton’s third law (action-reaction).

For two bodies having masses m and M with a distance r between their centers of mass, the equation for Newton’s universal law
of gravitation is

where F is the magnitude of the gravitational force and G is a proportionality factor called the gravitational constant. G is a
universal constant, meaning that it is thought to be the same everywhere in the universe. It has been measured experimentally
.
to be
If a person has a mass of 60.0 kg, what would be the force of gravitational attraction on him at Earth’s surface? G is given above,
Earth’s mass M is 5.97 × 1024 kg, and the radius r of Earth is 6.38 × 106 m. Putting these values into Newton’s universal law of
gravitation gives

We can check this result with the relationship:
You may remember that g, the acceleration due to gravity, is another important constant related to gravity. By substituting g for
a in the equation for Newton’s second law of motion we get
. Combining this with the equation for universal
gravitation gives

Cancelling the mass m on both sides of the equation and filling in the values for the gravitational constant and mass and radius
of the Earth, gives the value of g, which may look familiar.

This is a good point to recall the difference between mass and weight. Mass is the amount of matter in an object; weight is the

force of attraction between the mass within two objects. Weight can change because g is different on every moon and planet. An
object’s mass m does not change but its weight mg can.

Why do some objects fall faster than others near the surface of the earth if all mass is attracted equally by the force of
gravity?
a. Some objects fall faster because of air resistance, which acts in the direction of the motion of the object and exerts
more force on objects with less surface area.
b. Some objects fall faster because of air resistance, which acts in the direction opposite the motion of the object and
exerts more force on objects with less surface area.
c. Some objects fall faster because of air resistance, which acts in the direction of motion of the object and exerts more

gravitation equation. This expression can be manipulated to produce the equation for Kepler’s third law. We saw earlier that the
expression r3/T2 is a constant for satellites orbiting the same massive object. The derivation of Kepler’s third law from Newton’s
law of universal gravitation and Newton’s second law of motion yields that constant:

where M is the mass of the central body about which the satellites orbit (for example, the sun in our solar system). The
usefulness of this equation will be seen later.
The universal gravitational constant G is determined experimentally. This definition was first done accurately in 1798 by English
scientist Henry Cavendish (1731–1810), more than 100 years after Newton published his universal law of gravitation. The
measurement of G is very basic and important because it determines the strength of one of the four forces in nature.
Cavendish’s experiment was very difficult because he measured the tiny gravitational attraction between two ordinary-sized
masses (tens of kilograms at most) by using an apparatus like that in Figure 7.9. Remarkably, his value for G differs by less than
1% from the modern value.

Figure 7.9 Cavendish used an apparatus like this to measure the gravitational attraction between two suspended spheres (m) and two
spheres on a stand (M) by observing the amount of torsion (twisting) created in the fiber. The distance between the masses can be varied to
check the dependence of the force on distance. Modern experiments of this type continue to explore gravity.

Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity
Einstein’s theory of general relativity explained some interesting properties of gravity not covered by Newton’s theory. Einstein
based his theory on the postulate that acceleration and gravity have the same effect and cannot be distinguished from each
other. He concluded that light must fall in both a gravitational field and in an accelerating reference frame. Figure 7.10 shows
this effect (greatly exaggerated) in an accelerating elevator. In Figure 7.10(a), the elevator accelerates upward in zero gravity. In
Figure 7.10(b), the room is not accelerating but is subject to gravity. The effect on light is the same: it “falls” downward in both
situations. The person in the elevator cannot tell whether the elevator is accelerating in zero gravity or is stationary and subject
to gravity. Thus, gravity affects the path of light, even though we think of gravity as acting between masses, while photons are
massless.

Figure 7.10 (a) A beam of light emerges from a flashlight in an upward-accelerating elevator. Since the elevator moves up during the time
the light takes to reach the wall, the beam strikes lower than it would if the elevator were not accelerated. (b) Gravity must have the same
effect on light, since it is not possible to tell whether the elevator is accelerating upward or is stationary and acted upon by gravity.

Einstein’s theory of general relativity got its first verification in 1919 when starlight passing near the sun was observed during a
solar eclipse. (See Figure 7.11.) During an eclipse, the sky is darkened and we can briefly see stars. Those on a line of sight nearest
the sun should have a shift in their apparent positions. Not only was this shift observed, but it agreed with Einstein’s predictions
well within experimental uncertainties. This discovery created a scientific and public sensation. Einstein was now a folk hero as
well as a very great scientist. The bending of light by matter is equivalent to a bending of space itself, with light following the
curve. This is another radical change in our concept of space and time. It is also another connection that any particle with mass
or energy (e.g., massless photons) is affected by gravity.

Figure 7.11 This schematic shows how light passing near a massive body like the sun is curved toward it. The light that reaches the Earth
then seems to be coming from different locations than the known positions of the originating stars. Not only was this effect observed, but
the amount of bending was precisely what Einstein predicted in his general theory of relativity.

To summarize the two views of gravity, Newton envisioned gravity as a tug of war along the line connecting any two objects in
the universe. In contrast, Einstein envisioned gravity as a bending of space-time by mass.

NASA gravity probe B

NASA’s Gravity Probe B (GP-B) mission has confirmed two key predictions derived from Albert Einstein’s general theory of
relativity. The probe, shown in Figure 7.12 was launched in 2004. It carried four ultra-precise gyroscopes designed to measure
two effects hypothesized by Einstein’s theory:
• The geodetic effect, which is the warping of space and time by the gravitational field of a massive body (in this case, Earth)
• The frame-dragging effect, which is the amount by which a spinning object pulls space and time with it as it rotates

Figure 7.12 Artist concept of Gravity Probe B spacecraft in orbit around the Earth. (credit: NASA/MSFC)

Both effects were measured with unprecedented precision. This was done by pointing the gyroscopes at a single star while
orbiting Earth in a polar orbit. As predicted by relativity theory, the gyroscopes experienced very small, but measureable,
changes in the direction of their spin caused by the pull of Earth’s gravity.
The principle investigator suggested imagining Earth spinning in honey. As Earth rotates it drags space and time with it as it
would a surrounding sea of honey.

According to the general theory of relativity, a gravitational field bends light. What does this have to do with time and space?
a. Gravity has no effect on the space-time continuum, and gravity only affects the motion of light.
b. The space-time continuum is distorted by gravity, and gravity has no effect on the motion of light.
c. Gravity has no effect on either the space-time continuum or on the motion of light.
d. The space-time continuum is distorted by gravity, and gravity affects the motion of light.

Calculations Based on Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
When performing calculations using the equations in this chapter, use units of kilograms for mass, meters for distances,
newtons for force, and seconds for time.
The mass of an object is constant, but its weight varies with the strength of the gravitational field. This means the value of g
varies from place to place in the universe. The relationship between force, mass, and acceleration from the second law of motion
can be written in terms of g.

In this case, the force is the weight of the object, which is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet or moon on which
the object is located. We can use this expression to compare weights of an object on different moons and planets.

Would you have the same mass on the moon as you do on Earth? Would you have the same weight?
a. You would weigh more on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is stronger than gravity on Earth.
b. You would weigh less on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is weaker than gravity on Earth.
c. You would weigh less on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is stronger than gravity on Earth.
d. You would weigh more on the moon than on Earth because gravity on the moon is weaker than gravity on Earth.

Two equations involving the gravitational constant, G, are often useful. The first is Newton’s equation,

. Several of

the values in this equation are either constants or easily obtainable. F is often the weight of an object on the surface of a large
object with mass M, which is usually known. The mass of the smaller object, m, is often known, and G is a universal constant
with the same value anywhere in the universe. This equation can be used to solve problems involving an object on or orbiting
Earth or other massive celestial object. Sometimes it is helpful to equate the right-hand side of the equation to mg and cancel
the m on both sides.
The equation

is also useful for problems involving objects in orbit. Note that there is no need to know the mass of the

object. Often, we know the radius r or the period T and want to find the other. If these are both known, we can use the equation
to calculate the mass of a planet or star.

INTRODUCTION We know from everyday use of the word momentum that it is a tendency to continue on course in the same
direction. Newscasters speak of sports teams or politicians gaining, losing, or maintaining the momentum to win. As we
learned when studying about inertia, which is Newton's first law of motion, every object or system has inertia—that is, a
tendency for an object in motion to remain in motion or an object at rest to remain at rest. Mass is a useful variable that lets us
quantify inertia. Momentum is mass in motion.
Momentum is important because it is conserved in isolated systems; this fact is convenient for solving problems where objects
collide. The magnitude of momentum grows with greater mass and/or speed. For example, look at the football players in the
photograph (Figure 8.1). They collide and fall to the ground. During their collisions, momentum will play a large part. In this
chapter, we will learn about momentum, the different types of collisions, and how to use momentum equations to solve collision
problems.

Momentum, Impulse, and the Impulse-Momentum Theorem
Linear momentum is the product of a system’s mass and its velocity. In equation form, linear momentum p is
You can see from the equation that momentum is directly proportional to the object’s mass (m) and velocity (v). Therefore, the
greater an object’s mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum. A large, fast-moving object has greater
momentum than a smaller, slower object.
Momentum is a vector and has the same direction as velocity v. Since mass is a scalar, when velocity is in a negative direction
(i.e., opposite the direction of motion), the momentum will also be in a negative direction; and when velocity is in a positive
direction, momentum will likewise be in a positive direction. The SI unit for momentum is kg m/s.
Momentum is so important for understanding motion that it was called the quantity of motion by physicists such as Newton.
Force influences momentum, and we can rearrange Newton’s second law of motion to show the relationship between force and
momentum.
Recall our study of Newton’s second law of motion (Fnet = ma). Newton actually stated his second law of motion in terms of
momentum: The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes. The
change in momentum is the difference between the final and initial values of momentum.
In equation form, this law is

is known as impulse and this equation is known as the impulse-momentum theorem. From the equation, we see that
the impulse equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts. It is equal to the change in momentum.
The effect of a force on an object depends on how long it acts, as well as the strength of the force. Impulse is a useful concept
because it quantifies the effect of a force. A very large force acting for a short time can have a great effect on the momentum of
an object, such as the force of a racket hitting a tennis ball. A small force could cause the same change in momentum, but it
would have to act for a much longer time.

Newton’s Second Law in Terms of Momentum
When Newton’s second law is expressed in terms of momentum, it can be used for solving problems where mass varies, since

LINKS TO PHYSICS
Engineering: Saving Lives Using the Concept of Impulse

Cars during the past several decades have gotten much safer. Seat belts play a major role in automobile safety by preventing
people from flying into the windshield in the event of a crash. Other safety features, such as airbags, are less visible or obvious,
but are also effective at making auto crashes less deadly (see Figure 8.2). Many of these safety features make use of the concept
of impulse from physics. Recall that impulse is the net force multiplied by the duration of time of the impact. This was expressed
mathematically as
.

Figure 8.2 Vehicles have safety features like airbags and seat belts installed.

Airbags allow the net force on the occupants in the car to act over a much longer time when there is a sudden stop. The
momentum change is the same for an occupant whether an airbag is deployed or not. But the force that brings the occupant to a
you can
stop will be much less if it acts over a larger time. By rearranging the equation for impulse to solve for force
see how increasing
while
stays the same will decrease Fnet. This is another example of an inverse relationship. Similarly, a
padded dashboard increases the time over which the force of impact acts, thereby reducing the force of impact.
Cars today have many plastic components. One advantage of plastics is their lighter weight, which results in better gas mileage.
Another advantage is that a car will crumple in a collision, especially in the event of a head-on collision. A longer collision time
means the force on the occupants of the car will be less. Deaths during car races decreased dramatically when the rigid frames of
racing cars were replaced with parts that could crumple or collapse in the event of an accident.

(a) Calculate the momentum of a 110 kg football player running at 8 m/s. (b) Compare the player’s momentum with the
momentum of a 0.410 kg football thrown hard at a speed of 25 m/s.
Strategy
No information is given about the direction of the football player or the football, so we can calculate only the magnitude of the

calculated directly from the definition of momentum:

Discussion
Although the ball has greater velocity, the player has a much greater mass. Therefore, the momentum of the player is about 86
times greater than the momentum of the football.

ball’s speed just after impact was 58 m/s, the horizontal velocity before impact is negligible, and that the ball remained in
contact with the racquet for 5 ms (milliseconds).

law of conservation of momentum

Conservation of Momentum
It is important we realize that momentum is conserved during collisions, explosions, and other events involving objects in
motion. To say that a quantity is conserved means that it is constant throughout the event. In the case of conservation of
momentum, the total momentum in the system remains the same before and after the collision.
You may have noticed that momentum was not conserved in some of the examples previously presented in this chapter. where
forces acting on the objects produced large changes in momentum. Why is this? The systems of interest considered in those
problems were not inclusive enough. If the systems were expanded to include more objects, then momentum would in fact be
conserved in those sample problems. It is always possible to find a larger system where momentum is conserved, even though
momentum changes for individual objects within the system.
For example, if a football player runs into the goalpost in the end zone, a force will cause him to bounce backward. His
momentum is obviously greatly changed, and considering only the football player, we would find that momentum is not
conserved. However, the system can be expanded to contain the entire Earth. Surprisingly, Earth also recoils—conserving
momentum—because of the force applied to it through the goalpost. The effect on Earth is not noticeable because it is so much
more massive than the player, but the effect is real.
Next, consider what happens if the masses of two colliding objects are more similar than the masses of a football player and
Earth—in the example shown in Figure 8.4 of one car bumping into another. Both cars are coasting in the same direction when
the lead car, labeled m2, is bumped by the trailing car, labeled m1. The only unbalanced force on each car is the force of the
collision, assuming that the effects due to friction are negligible. Car m1 slows down as a result of the collision, losing some
momentum, while car m2 speeds up and gains some momentum. If we choose the system to include both cars and assume that
friction is negligible, then the momentum of the two-car system should remain constant. Now we will prove that the total
momentum of the two-car system does in fact remain constant, and is therefore conserved.

259

260

Chapter 8 • Momentum

Figure 8.4 Car of mass m1 moving with a velocity of v1 bumps into another car of mass m2 and velocity v2. As a result, the first car slows
down to a velocity of v′1 and the second speeds up to a velocity of v′2. The momentum of each car is changed, but the total momentum ptot
of the two cars is the same before and after the collision if you assume friction is negligible.

Using the impulse-momentum theorem, the change in momentum of car 1 is given by

where F1 is the force on car 1 due to car 2, and

is the time the force acts, or the duration of the collision.

Similarly, the change in momentum of car 2 is
where F2 is the force on car 2 due to car 1, and we assume the
is the same for both cars. We know from Newton’s third law of motion that F2 = –F1, and so
duration of the collision
.
Therefore, the changes in momentum are equal and opposite, and

.

Because the changes in momentum add to zero, the total momentum of the two-car system is constant. That is,

where p′1 and p′2 are the momenta of cars 1 and 2 after the collision.
This result that momentum is conserved is true not only for this example involving the two cars, but for any system where the
net external force is zero, which is known as an isolated system. The law of conservation of momentum states that for an
isolated system with any number of objects in it, the total momentum is conserved. In equation form, the law of conservation of
momentum for an isolated system is written as

or

where ptot is the total momentum, or the sum of the momenta of the individual objects in the system at a given time, and p′tot is
the total momentum some time later.
The conservation of momentum principle can be applied to systems as diverse as a comet striking the Earth or a gas containing
huge numbers of atoms and molecules. Conservation of momentum appears to be violated only when the net external force is
not zero. But another larger system can always be considered in which momentum is conserved by simply including the source
of the external force. For example, in the collision of two cars considered above, the two-car system conserves momentum while
each one-car system does not.

Momenta is the plural form of the word momentum. One object is said to have momentum, but two or more objects are said

FUN IN PHYSICS
Angular Momentum in Figure Skating

So far we have covered linear momentum, which describes the inertia of objects traveling in a straight line. But we know that
many objects in nature have a curved or circular path. Just as linear motion has linear momentum to describe its tendency to
move forward, circular motion has the equivalent angular momentum to describe how rotational motion is carried forward.
This is similar to how torque is analogous to force, angular acceleration is analogous to translational acceleration, and mr2 is
analogous to mass or inertia. You may recall learning that the quantity mr2 is called the rotational inertia or moment of inertia
of a point mass m at a distance r from the center of rotation.
We already know the equation for linear momentum, p = mv. Since angular momentum is analogous to linear momentum, the
moment of inertia (I) is analogous to mass, and angular velocity
is analogous to linear velocity, it makes sense that angular
momentum (L) is defined as
Angular momentum is conserved when the net external torque ( ) is zero, just as linear momentum is conserved when the net
external force is zero.
Figure skaters take advantage of the conservation of angular momentum, likely without even realizing it. In Figure 8.5, a figure
skater is executing a spin. The net torque on her is very close to zero, because there is relatively little friction between her skates
and the ice, and because the friction is exerted very close to the pivot point. Both F and r are small, and so is negligibly small.

Figure 8.5 (a) An ice skater is spinning on the tip of her skate with her arms extended. In the next image, (b), her rate of spin increases
greatly when she pulls in her arms.

Consequently, she can spin for quite some time. She can do something else, too. She can increase her rate of spin by pulling her
arms and legs in. Why does pulling her arms and legs in increase her rate of spin? The answer is that her angular momentum is
constant, so that L = L′.
Expressing this equation in terms of the moment of inertia,

where the primed quantities refer to conditions after she has pulled in her arms and reduced her moment of inertia. Because I′
is smaller, the angular velocity
must increase to keep the angular momentum constant. This allows her to spin much faster
without exerting any extra torque.
A video (http://openstax.org/l/28figureskater) is also available that shows a real figure skater executing a spin. It discusses the
physics of spins in figure skating.

Elastic and Inelastic Collisions
When objects collide, they can either stick together or bounce off one another, remaining separate. In this section, we’ll cover
these two different types of collisions, first in one dimension and then in two dimensions.
In an elastic collision, the objects separate after impact and don’t lose any of their kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of
motion and is covered in detail elsewhere. The law of conservation of momentum is very useful here, and it can be used
whenever the net external force on a system is zero. Figure 8.6 shows an elastic collision where momentum is conserved.

Figure 8.6 The diagram shows a one-dimensional elastic collision between two objects.

An animation of an elastic collision between balls can be seen by watching this video (http://openstax.org/l/28elasticball) . It
replicates the elastic collisions between balls of varying masses.
Perfectly elastic collisions can happen only with subatomic particles. Everyday observable examples of perfectly elastic collisions
don’t exist—some kinetic energy is always lost, as it is converted into heat transfer due to friction. However, collisions between
everyday objects are almost perfectly elastic when they occur with objects and surfaces that are nearly frictionless, such as with
two steel blocks on ice.
Now, to solve problems involving one-dimensional elastic collisions between two objects, we can use the equation for
conservation of momentum. First, the equation for conservation of momentum for two objects in a one-dimensional collision is

Substituting the definition of momentum p = mv for each initial and final momentum, we get

where the primes (') indicate values after the collision; In some texts, you may see i for initial (before collision) and f for final
(after collision). The equation assumes that the mass of each object does not change during the collision.

Now, let us turn to the second type of collision. An inelastic collision is one in which objects stick together after impact, and
kinetic energy is not conserved. This lack of conservation means that the forces between colliding objects may convert kinetic
energy to other forms of energy, such as potential energy or thermal energy. The concepts of energy are discussed more
thoroughly elsewhere. For inelastic collisions, kinetic energy may be lost in the form of heat. Figure 8.7 shows an example of an
inelastic collision. Two objects that have equal masses head toward each other at equal speeds and then stick together. The two
objects come to rest after sticking together, conserving momentum but not kinetic energy after they collide. Some of the energy
of motion gets converted to thermal energy, or heat.

objects of equal mass initially head directly toward each other at the same speed. (b) The objects stick together, creating a perfectly
inelastic collision. In the case shown in this figure, the combined objects stop; This is not true for all inelastic collisions.

Since the two objects stick together after colliding, they move together at the same speed. This lets us simplify the conservation
of momentum equation from

to

for inelastic collisions, where v′ is the final velocity for both objects as they are stuck together, either in motion or at rest.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Here’s a trick for remembering which collisions are elastic and which are inelastic: Elastic is a bouncy material, so when
objects bounce off one another in the collision and separate, it is an elastic collision. When they don’t, the collision is
inelastic.

Solving Collision Problems
The Khan Academy videos referenced in this section show examples of elastic and inelastic collisions in one dimension. In onedimensional collisions, the incoming and outgoing velocities are all along the same line. But what about collisions, such as those
between billiard balls, in which objects scatter to the side? These are two-dimensional collisions, and just as we did with twodimensional forces, we will solve these problems by first choosing a coordinate system and separating the motion into its x and y
components.
One complication with two-dimensional collisions is that the objects might rotate before or after their collision. For example, if
two ice skaters hook arms as they pass each other, they will spin in circles. We will not consider such rotation until later, and so
for now, we arrange things so that no rotation is possible. To avoid rotation, we consider only the scattering of point
masses—that is, structureless particles that cannot rotate or spin.
We start by assuming that Fnet = 0, so that momentum p is conserved. The simplest collision is one in which one of the particles
is initially at rest. The best choice for a coordinate system is one with an axis parallel to the velocity of the incoming particle, as
shown in Figure 8.8. Because momentum is conserved, the components of momentum along the x- and y-axes, displayed as px
and py, will also be conserved. With the chosen coordinate system, py is initially zero and px is the momentum of the incoming
particle.

Now, we will take the conservation of momentum equation, p1 + p2 = p′1 + p′2 and break it into its x and y components.
Along the x-axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is

In terms of masses and velocities, this equation is
8.3
But because particle 2 is initially at rest, this equation becomes
8.4
The components of the velocities along the x-axis have the form v cos θ . Because particle 1 initially moves along the x-axis, we
find v1x = v1. Conservation of momentum along the x-axis gives the equation

are as shown in Figure 8.8.

Along the y-axis, the equation for conservation of momentum is

But v1y is zero, because particle 1 initially moves along the x-axis. Because particle 2 is initially at rest, v2y is also zero. The
equation for conservation of momentum along the y-axis becomes

The components of the velocities along the y-axis have the form v sin . Therefore, conservation of momentum along the y-axis

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating Velocity: Inelastic Collision of a Puck and a Goalie

Find the recoil velocity of a 70 kg ice hockey goalie who catches a 0.150-kg hockey puck slapped at him at a velocity of 35 m/s.
Assume that the goalie is at rest before catching the puck, and friction between the ice and the puck-goalie system is negligible
(see Figure 8.9).

Figure 8.9

An ice hockey goalie catches a hockey puck and recoils backward in an inelastic collision.

Strategy
Momentum is conserved because the net external force on the puck-goalie system is zero. Therefore, we can use conservation of
momentum to find the final velocity of the puck and goalie system. Note that the initial velocity of the goalie is zero and that the
final velocity of the puck and goalie are the same.
Solution
For an inelastic collision, conservation of momentum is
8.8
where v′ is the velocity of both the goalie and the puck after impact. Because the goalie is initially at rest, we know v2 = 0. This
simplifies the equation to
8.9
Solving for v′ yields

Calculating Final Velocity: Elastic Collision of Two Carts

Two hard, steel carts collide head-on and then ricochet off each other in opposite directions on a frictionless surface (see Figure
8.10). Cart 1 has a mass of 0.350 kg and an initial velocity of 2 m/s. Cart 2 has a mass of 0.500 kg and an initial velocity of −0.500
m/s. After the collision, cart 1 recoils with a velocity of −4 m/s. What is the final velocity of cart 2?

Figure 8.10

Two carts collide with each other in an elastic collision.

Strategy
Since the track is frictionless, Fnet = 0 and we can use conservation of momentum to find the final velocity of cart 2.

As before, the equation for conservation of momentum for a one-dimensional elastic collision in a two-object system is
8.12
The only unknown in this equation is v′2. Solving for v′2 and substituting known values into the previous equation yields

The final velocity of cart 2 is large and positive, meaning that it is moving to the right after the collision.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating Final Velocity in a Two-Dimensional Collision

Suppose the following experiment is performed (Figure 8.11). An object of mass 0.250 kg (m1) is slid on a frictionless surface into
a dark room, where it strikes an initially stationary object of mass 0.400 kg (m2). The 0.250 kg object emerges from the room at
an angle of 45º with its incoming direction. The speed of the 0.250 kg object is originally 2 m/s and is 1.50 m/s after the collision.
Calculate the magnitude and direction of the velocity (v′2 and ) of the 0.400 kg object after the collision.

Figure 8.11

The incoming object of mass m1 is scattered by an initially stationary object. Only the stationary object’s mass m2 is known.

By measuring the angle and speed at which the object of mass m1 emerges from the room, it is possible to calculate the magnitude and
direction of the initially stationary object’s velocity after the collision.

Strategy
Momentum is conserved because the surface is frictionless. We chose the coordinate system so that the initial velocity is parallel
to the x-axis, and conservation of momentum along the x- and y-axes applies.
Everything is known in these equations except v′2 and θ2, which we need to find. We can find two unknowns because we have
two independent equations—the equations describing the conservation of momentum in the x and y directions.
Solution
First, we’ll solve both conservation of momentum equations (
) for v′2 sin .

and

For conservation of momentum along x-axis, let’s substitute sin /tan for cos so that terms may cancel out later on. This
comes from rearranging the definition of the trigonometric identity tan = sin /cos . This gives us
8.14
Solving for v′2 sin

yields

For conservation of momentum along y-axis, solving for v′2 sin

yields

Chapter 8 • Momentum

Since both equations equal v′2 sin

, we can set them equal to one another, yielding

Solving this equation for tan

, we get
8.18

Entering known values into the previous equation gives
8.19
Therefore,
8.20
Since angles are defined as positive in the counterclockwise direction, m2 is scattered to the right.
We’ll use the conservation of momentum along the y-axis equation to solve for v′2.
8.21
Entering known values into this equation gives
8.22
Therefore,
8.23
Discussion
Either equation for the x- or y-axis could have been used to solve for v′2, but the equation for the y-axis is easier because it has
fewer terms.

SECTION SUMMARY
8.1 Linear Momentum, Force, and
Impulse
• Linear momentum, often referenced as momentum for
short, is defined as the product of a system’s mass
multiplied by its velocity,
p = mv.
• The SI unit for momentum is kg m/s.
• Newton’s second law of motion in terms of momentum
states that the net external force equals the change in
momentum of a system divided by the time over which
it changes,

.

• Impulse is the average net external force multiplied by
the time this force acts, and impulse equals the change
in momentum,
.
• Forces are usually not constant over a period of time, so
we use the average of the force over the time it acts.

8.2 Conservation of Momentum
• The law of conservation of momentum is written ptot =
constant or ptot = p′tot (isolated system), where ptot is the
initial total momentum and p′tot is the total momentum
some time later.

• In an isolated system, the net external force is zero.
• Conservation of momentum applies only when the net
external force is zero, within the defined system.

8.3 Elastic and Inelastic Collisions
• If objects separate after impact, the collision is elastic;
If they stick together, the collision is inelastic.
• Kinetic energy is conserved in an elastic collision, but
not in an inelastic collision.
• The approach to two-dimensional collisions is to choose
a convenient coordinate system and break the motion
into components along perpendicular axes. Choose a
coordinate system with the x-axis parallel to the velocity
of the incoming particle.
• Two-dimensional collisions of point masses, where
mass 2 is initially at rest, conserve momentum along
the initial direction of mass 1, or the x-axis, and along
the direction perpendicular to the initial direction, or
the y-axis.
• Point masses are structureless particles that cannot
spin.

INTRODUCTION Roller coasters have provided thrills for daring riders around the world since the nineteenth century.
Inventors of roller coasters used simple physics to build the earliest examples using railroad tracks on mountainsides and old
mines. Modern roller coaster designers use the same basic laws of physics to create the latest amusement park favorites. Physics
principles are used to engineer the machines that do the work to lift a roller coaster car up its first big incline before it is set
loose to roll. Engineers also have to understand the changes in the car’s energy that keep it speeding over hills, through twists,
turns, and even loops.
What exactly is energy? How can changes in force, energy, and simple machines move objects like roller coaster cars? How can
machines help us do work? In this chapter, you will discover the answer to this question and many more, as you learn about

The Work–Energy Theorem
In physics, the term work has a very specific definition. Work is application of force, , to move an object over a distance, d, in
the direction that the force is applied. Work, W, is described by the equation
Some things that we typically consider to be work are not work in the scientific sense of the term. Let’s consider a few examples.
Think about why each of the following statements is true.
• Homework is not work.
• Lifting a rock upwards off the ground is work.
• Carrying a rock in a straight path across the lawn at a constant speed is not work.
The first two examples are fairly simple. Homework is not work because objects are not being moved over a distance. Lifting a
rock up off the ground is work because the rock is moving in the direction that force is applied. The last example is less obvious.
Recall from the laws of motion that force is not required to move an object at constant velocity. Therefore, while some force may
be applied to keep the rock up off the ground, no net force is applied to keep the rock moving forward at constant velocity.
Work and energy are closely related. When you do work to move an object, you change the object’s energy. You (or an object) also
expend energy to do work. In fact, energy can be defined as the ability to do work. Energy can take a variety of different forms,
and one form of energy can transform to another. In this chapter we will be concerned with mechanical energy, which comes in
two forms: kinetic energy and potential energy.
• Kinetic energy is also called energy of motion. A moving object has kinetic energy.
• Potential energy, sometimes called stored energy, comes in several forms. Gravitational potential energy is the stored
energy an object has as a result of its position above Earth’s surface (or another object in space). A roller coaster car at the
top of a hill has gravitational potential energy.
Let’s examine how doing work on an object changes the object’s energy. If we apply force to lift a rock off the ground, we
increase the rock’s potential energy, PE. If we drop the rock, the force of gravity increases the rock’s kinetic energy as the rock
moves downward until it hits the ground.
The force we exert to lift the rock is equal to its weight, w, which is equal to its mass, m, multiplied by acceleration due to gravity,
g.

The work we do on the rock equals the force we exert multiplied by the distance, d, that we lift the rock. The work we do on the
rock also equals the rock’s gain in gravitational potential energy, PEe.

Kinetic energy depends on the mass of an object and its velocity, v.

9.1 • Work, Power, and the Work–Energy Theorem

When we drop the rock the force of gravity causes the rock to fall, giving the rock kinetic energy. When work done on an object
increases only its kinetic energy, then the net work equals the change in the value of the quantity
. This is a statement of
the work–energy theorem, which is expressed mathematically as

The subscripts 2 and 1 indicate the final and initial velocity, respectively. This theorem was proposed and successfully tested by
James Joule, shown in Figure 9.2.
Does the name Joule sound familiar? The joule (J) is the metric unit of measurement for both work and energy. The
measurement of work and energy with the same unit reinforces the idea that work and energy are related and can be converted
into one another. 1.0 J = 1.0 N∙m, the units of force multiplied by distance. 1.0 N = 1.0 k∙m/s2, so 1.0 J = 1.0 k∙m2/s2. Analyzing
the units of the term (1/2)mv2 will produce the same units for joules.

Figure 9.2 The joule is named after physicist James Joule (1818–1889). (C. H. Jeens, Wikimedia Commons)

Calculations Involving Work and Power
In applications that involve work, we are often interested in how fast the work is done. For example, in roller coaster design, the
amount of time it takes to lift a roller coaster car to the top of the first hill is an important consideration. Taking a half hour on
the ascent will surely irritate riders and decrease ticket sales. Let’s take a look at how to calculate the time it takes to do work.
Recall that a rate can be used to describe a quantity, such as work, over a period of time. Power is the rate at which work is done.
In this case, rate means per unit of time. Power is calculated by dividing the work done by the time it took to do the work.

Let’s consider an example that can help illustrate the differences among work, force, and power. Suppose the woman in Figure
9.3 lifting the TV with a pulley gets the TV to the fourth floor in two minutes, and the man carrying the TV up the stairs takes five

281

282

Chapter 9 • Work, Energy, and Simple Machines

minutes to arrive at the same place. They have done the same amount of work
on the TV, because they have moved the same
mass over the same vertical distance, which requires the same amount of upward force. However, the woman using the pulley
has generated more power. This is because she did the work in a shorter amount of time, so the denominator of the power
formula, t, is smaller. (For simplicity’s sake, we will leave aside for now the fact that the man climbing the stairs has also done
work on himself.)

Figure 9.3 No matter how you move a TV to the fourth floor, the amount of work performed and the potential energy gain are the same.

Power can be expressed in units of watts (W). This unit can be used to measure power related to any form of energy or work. You
have most likely heard the term used in relation to electrical devices, especially light bulbs. Multiplying power by time gives the
amount of energy. Electricity is sold in kilowatt-hours because that equals the amount of electrical energy consumed.
The watt unit was named after James Watt (1736–1819) (see Figure 9.4). He was a Scottish engineer and inventor who discovered
how to coax more power out of steam engines.

LINKS TO PHYSICS
Watt’s Steam Engine

James Watt did not invent the steam engine, but by the time he was finished tinkering with it, it was more useful. The first
steam engines were not only inefficient, they only produced a back and forth, or reciprocal, motion. This was natural because
pistons move in and out as the pressure in the chamber changes. This limitation was okay for simple tasks like pumping water or
mashing potatoes, but did not work so well for moving a train. Watt was able build a steam engine that converted reciprocal
motion to circular motion. With that one innovation, the industrial revolution was off and running. The world would never be
the same. One of Watt's steam engines is shown in Figure 9.5. The video that follows the figure explains the importance of the
steam engine in the industrial revolution.

Section Key Terms
law of conservation of energy

Mechanical Energy and Conservation of Energy
We saw earlier that mechanical energy can be either potential or kinetic. In this section we will see how energy is transformed
from one of these forms to the other. We will also see that, in a closed system, the sum of these forms of energy remains
constant.
Quite a bit of potential energy is gained by a roller coaster car and its passengers when they are raised to the top of the first hill.
Remember that the potential part of the term means that energy has been stored and can be used at another time. You will see
that this stored energy can either be used to do work or can be transformed into kinetic energy. For example, when an object
that has gravitational potential energy falls, its energy is converted to kinetic energy. Remember that both work and energy are
expressed in joules.
Refer back to . The amount of work required to raise the TV from point A to point B is equal to the amount of gravitational
potential energy the TV gains from its height above the ground. This is generally true for any object raised above the ground. If
all the work done on an object is used to raise the object above the ground, the amount work equals the object’s gain in
gravitational potential energy. However, note that because of the work done by friction, these energy–work transformations are
never perfect. Friction causes the loss of some useful energy. In the discussions to follow, we will use the approximation that
transformations are frictionless.
Now, let’s look at the roller coaster in Figure 9.6. Work was done on the roller coaster to get it to the top of the first rise; at this
point, the roller coaster has gravitational potential energy. It is moving slowly, so it also has a small amount of kinetic energy. As
the car descends the first slope, its PE is converted to KE. At the low point much of the original PE has been transformed to KE,
and speed is at a maximum. As the car moves up the next slope, some of the KE is transformed back into PE and the car slows
down.

increasing?
a. The mechanical energy of the system increases, provided there is no loss of energy due to friction. The energy would
transform to kinetic energy when the speed is increasing.
b. The mechanical energy of the system remains constant provided there is no loss of energy due to friction. The
energy would transform to kinetic energy when the speed is increasing.
c. The mechanical energy of the system increases provided there is no loss of energy due to friction. The energy would
transform to potential energy when the speed is increasing.
d. The mechanical energy of the system remains constant provided there is no loss of energy due to friction. The
energy would transform to potential energy when the speed is increasing.

On an actual roller coaster, there are many ups and downs, and each of these is accompanied by transitions between kinetic and
potential energy. Assume that no energy is lost to friction. At any point in the ride, the total mechanical energy is the same, and
it is equal to the energy the car had at the top of the first rise. This is a result of the law of conservation of energy, which says
that, in a closed system, total energy is conserved—that is, it is constant. Using subscripts 1 and 2 to represent initial and final
energy, this law is expressed as

Either side equals the total mechanical energy. The phrase in a closed system means we are assuming no energy is lost to the
surroundings due to friction and air resistance. If we are making calculations on dense falling objects, this is a good
assumption. For the roller coaster, this assumption introduces some inaccuracy to the calculation.

Note that we can solve many problems involving conversion between KE and PE without knowing the mass of the object in
question. This is because kinetic and potential energy are both proportional to the mass of the object. In a situation where
KE = PE, we know that mgh = (1/2)mv2.
Dividing both sides by m and rearranging, we have the relationship

Simple Machines
Simple machines make work easier, but they do not decrease the amount of work you have to do. Why can’t simple machines
change the amount of work that you do? Recall that in closed systems the total amount of energy is conserved. A machine cannot
increase the amount of energy you put into it. So, why is a simple machine useful? Although it cannot change the amount of
work you do, a simple machine can change the amount of force you must apply to an object, and the distance over which you
apply the force. In most cases, a simple machine is used to reduce the amount of force you must exert to do work. The down side
is that you must exert the force over a greater distance, because the product of force and distance, fd, (which equals work) does
not change.
Let’s examine how this works in practice. In Figure 9.7(a), the worker uses a type of lever to exert a small force over a large
distance, while the pry bar pulls up on the nail with a large force over a small distance. Figure 9.7(b) shows the how a lever works
mathematically. The effort force, applied at Fe, lifts the load (the resistance force) which is pushing down at Fr. The triangular
pivot is called the fulcrum; the part of the lever between the fulcrum and Fe is the effort arm, Le; and the part to the left is the
resistance arm, Lr. The mechanical advantage is a number that tells us how many times a simple machine multiplies the effort
force. The ideal mechanical advantage, IMA, is the mechanical advantage of a perfect machine with no loss of useful work
caused by friction between moving parts. The equation for IMA is shown in Figure 9.7(b).

Figure 9.7 (a) A pry bar is a type of lever. (b) The ideal mechanical advantage equals the length of the effort arm divided by the length of the
resistance arm of a lever.

In general, the IMA = the resistance force, Fr, divided by the effort force, Fe. IMA also equals the distance over which the effort is
applied, de, divided by the distance the load travels, dr.

Getting back to conservation of energy, for any simple machine, the work put into the machine, Wi, equals the work the
machine puts out, Wo. Combining this with the information in the paragraphs above, we can write

The equations show how a simple machine can output the same amount of work while reducing the amount of effort force by
increasing the distance over which the effort force is applied.

from the lengths of the lever arms, and; (3) from the distance over which the force is applied and the distance the load moves.

Two children of different weights are riding a seesaw. How do they position themselves with respect to the pivot point (the
fulcrum) so that they are balanced?
a. The heavier child sits closer to the fulcrum.
b. The heavier child sits farther from the fulcrum.
c. Both children sit at equal distance from the fulcrum.
d. Since both have different weights, they will never be in balance.

Some levers exert a large force to a short effort arm. This results in a smaller force acting over a greater distance at the end of the
resistance arm. Examples of this type of lever are baseball bats, hammers, and golf clubs. In another type of lever, the fulcrum is
at the end of the lever and the load is in the middle, as in the design of a wheelbarrow.
The simple machine shown in Figure 9.8 is called a wheel and axle. It is actually a form of lever. The difference is that the effort
arm can rotate in a complete circle around the fulcrum, which is the center of the axle. Force applied to the outside of the wheel
causes a greater force to be applied to the rope that is wrapped around the axle. As shown in the figure, the ideal mechanical
advantage is calculated by dividing the radius of the wheel by the radius of the axle. Any crank-operated device is an example of
a wheel and axle.

Figure 9.8 Force applied to a wheel exerts a force on its axle.

An inclined plane and a wedge are two forms of the same simple machine. A wedge is simply two inclined planes back to back.
Figure 9.9 shows the simple formulas for calculating the IMAs of these machines. All sloping, paved surfaces for walking or
driving are inclined planes. Knives and axe heads are examples of wedges.

Figure 9.9 An inclined plane is shown on the left, and a wedge is shown on the right.

The screw shown in Figure 9.10 is actually a lever attached to a circular inclined plane. Wood screws (of course) are also examples
of screws. The lever part of these screws is a screw driver. In the formula for IMA, the distance between screw threads is called
pitch and has the symbol P.

Figure 9.10 The screw shown here is used to lift very heavy objects, like the corner of a car or a house a short distance.

Figure 9.11 shows three different pulley systems. Of all simple machines, mechanical advantage is easiest to calculate for pulleys.
Simply count the number of ropes supporting the load. That is the IMA. Once again we have to exert force over a longer distance
to multiply force. To raise a load 1 meter with a pulley system you have to pull N meters of rope. Pulley systems are often used to
raise flags and window blinds and are part of the mechanism of construction cranes.

GRASP CHECK
How could you use a pulley system to lift a light load to great height?
a. Reduce the radius of the pulley.
b. Increase the number of pulleys.
c. Decrease the number of ropes supporting the load.
d. Increase the number of ropes supporting the load.

A complex machine is a combination of two or more simple machines. The wire cutters in Figure 9.12 combine two levers and
two wedges. Bicycles include wheel and axles, levers, screws, and pulleys. Cars and other vehicles are combinations of many
machines.

Figure 9.12 Wire cutters are a common complex machine.

Calculating Mechanical Advantage and Efficiency of Simple Machines
In general, the IMA = the resistance force, Fr, divided by the effort force, Fe. IMA also equals the distance over which the effort is
applied, de, divided by the distance the load travels, dr.

Refer back to the discussions of each simple machine for the specific equations for the IMA for each type of machine.
No simple or complex machines have the actual mechanical advantages calculated by the IMA equations. In real life, some of the
applied work always ends up as wasted heat due to friction between moving parts. Both the input work (Wi) and output work
(Wo) are the result of a force, F, acting over a distance, d.
The efficiency output of a machine is simply the output work divided by the input work, and is usually multiplied by 100 so that
it is expressed as a percent.

Look back at the pictures of the simple machines and think about which would have the highest efficiency. Efficiency is related
to friction, and friction depends on the smoothness of surfaces and on the area of the surfaces in contact. How would
lubrication affect the efficiency of a simple machine?

WORKED EXAMPLE
Efficiency of a Lever

The input force of 11 N acting on the effort arm of a lever moves 0.4 m, which lifts a 40 N weight resting on the resistance arm a

Strategy
and calculate Wo and Wi. Both work values

State the equation for efficiency of a simple machine,
are the product Fd.
Solution
= (11)(0.4) = 4.4 J and

= (40)(0.1) = 4.0 J, then

Discussion
Efficiency in real machines will always be less than 100 percent because of work that is converted to unavailable heat by friction
and air resistance. Wo and Wi can always be calculated as a force multiplied by a distance, although these quantities are not
always as obvious as they are in the case of a lever.

Chapter Outline
10.1 Postulates of Special Relativity
10.2 Consequences of Special Relativity

INTRODUCTION Have you ever dreamed of traveling to other planets in faraway star systems? The trip might seem possible by
traveling fast enough, but you will read in this chapter why it is not. In 1905, Albert Einstein developed the theory of special
relativity. Einstein developed the theory to help explain inconsistencies between the equations describing electromagnetism
and Newtonian mechanics, and to explain why the ether did not exist. This theory explains the limit on an object’s speed among
other implications.
Relativity is the study of how different observers moving with respect to one another measure the same events. Galileo and
Newton developed the first correct version of classical relativity. Einstein developed the modern theory of relativity. Modern
relativity is divided into two parts. Special relativity deals with observers moving at constant velocity. General relativity deals
with observers moving at constant acceleration. Einstein’s theories of relativity made revolutionary predictions. Most
importantly, his predictions have been verified by experiments.
In this chapter, you learn how experiments and puzzling contradictions in existing theories led to the development of the theory
of special relativity. You will also learn the simple postulates on which the theory was based; a postulate is a statement that is
assumed to be true for the purposes of reasoning in a scientific or mathematic argument.

Scientific Experiments and Problems
Relativity is not new. Way back around the year 1600, Galileo explained that motion is relative. Wherever you happen to be, it
seems like you are at a fixed point and that everything moves with respect to you. Everyone else feels the same way. Motion is
always measured with respect to a fixed point. This is called establishing a frame of reference. But the choice of the point is
arbitrary, and all frames of reference are equally valid. A passenger in a moving car is not moving with respect to the driver, but
they are both moving from the point of view of a person on the sidewalk waiting for a bus. They are moving even faster as seen
by a person in a car coming toward them. It is all relative.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
A frame of reference is not a complicated concept. It is just something you decide is a fixed point or group of connected
points. It is completely up to you. For example, when you look up at celestial objects in the sky, you choose the earth as your
frame of reference, and the sun, moon, etc., seem to move across the sky.
Light is involved in the discussion of relativity because theories related to electromagnetism are inconsistent with Galileo’s and
Newton’s explanation of relativity. The true nature of light was a hot topic of discussion and controversy in the late 19th century.
At the time, it was not generally believed that light could travel across empty space. It was known to travel as waves, and all other
types of energy that propagated as waves needed to travel though a material medium. It was believed that space was filled with
an invisible medium that light waves traveled through. This imaginary (as it turned out) material was called the ether (also
spelled aether). It was thought that everything moved through this mysterious fluid. In other words, ether was the one fixed
frame of reference. The Michelson–Morley experiment proved it was not.
In 1887, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley designed the interferometer shown in Figure 10.2 to measure the speed of Earth
through the ether. A light beam is split into two perpendicular paths and then recombined. Recombining the waves produces an
inference pattern, with a bright fringe at the locations where the two waves arrive in phase; that is, with the crests of both waves
arriving together and the troughs arriving together. A dark fringe appears where the crest of one wave coincides with a trough
of the other, so that the two cancel. If Earth is traveling through the ether as it orbits the sun, the peaks in one arm would take
longer than in the other to reach the same location. The places where the two waves arrive in phase would change, and the
interference pattern would shift. But, using the interferometer, there was no shift seen! This result led to two conclusions: that
there is no ether and that the speed of light is the same regardless of the relative motion of source and observer. The
Michelson–Morley investigation has been called the most famous failed experiment in history.

To see what Michelson and Morley expected to find when they measured the speed of light in two directions, watch this
animation (http://openstax.org/l/28MMexperiment) . In the video, two people swimming in a lake are represented as an analogy
to light beams leaving Earth as it moves through the ether (if there were any ether). The swimmers swim away from and back to
a platform that is moving through the water. The swimmers swim in different directions with respect to the motion of the
platform. Even though they swim equal distances at the same speed, the motion of the platform causes them to arrive at
different times.

Einstein’s Postulates
The results described above left physicists with some puzzling and unsettling questions such as, why doesn’t light emitted by a
fast-moving object travel faster than light from a street lamp? A radical new theory was needed, and Albert Einstein, shown in
Figure 10.3, was about to become everyone’s favorite genius. Einstein began with two simple postulates based on the two things
we have discussed so far in this chapter.
1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.
2. The speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames and is not affected by the speed of its source.

Figure 10.3 Albert Einstein (1879–1955) developed modern relativity and also made fundamental contributions to the foundations of
quantum mechanics. (The Library of Congress)

The speed of light is given the symbol c and is equal to exactly 299,792,458 m/s. This is the speed of light in vacuum; that is, in the

motion remain in motion at a constant velocity in a straight line, unless acted upon by an external force. The inside of a car
moving along a road at constant velocity and the inside of a stationary house are inertial reference frames.

Snap Lab
Measure the Speed of Light

In this experiment, you will measure the speed of light using a microwave oven and a slice of bread. The waves generated by
a microwave oven are not part of the visible spectrum, but they are still electromagnetic radiation, so they travel at the speed
of light. If we know the wavelength, λ, and frequency, f, of a wave, we can calculate its speed, v, using the equation v = λf.
You can measure the wavelength. You will find the frequency on a label on the back of a microwave oven. The wave in a
microwave is a standing wave with areas of high and low intensity. The high intensity sections are one-half wavelength
apart.

2. Turn off the revolving feature of the microwave oven or remove the wheels under the microwave dish that make it turn.
It is important that the dish does not turn.
3. Place the slice of bread on the dish, set the microwave on high, close the door, run the microwave for about 15 seconds.
4. A row of brown or black marks should appear on the bread. Stop the microwave as soon as they appear. Measure the
distance between two adjacent burn marks and multiply the result by 2. This is the wavelength.
5. The frequency of the waves is written on the back of the microwave. Look for something like “2,450 MHz.” Hz is the unit
hertz, which means per second. The M represents mega, which stands for million, so multiply the number by 106.
6. Express the wavelength in meters and multiply it times the frequency. If you did everything correctly, you will get a
number very close to the speed of light. Do not eat the bread. It is a general laboratory safety rule never to eat anything
in the lab.

Einstein’s postulates were carefully chosen, and they both seemed very likely to be true. Einstein proceeded despite realizing
that these two ideas taken together and applied to extreme conditions led to results that contradict Newtonian mechanics. He
just took the ball and ran with it.
In the traditional view, velocities are additive. If you are running at 3 m/s and you throw a ball forward at a speed of 10 m/s, the
ball should have a net speed of 13 m/s. However, according to relativity theory, the speed of a moving light source is not added to
the speed of the emitted light.
In addition, Einstein’s theory shows that if you were moving forward relative to Earth at nearly c (the speed of light) and could
throw a ball forward at c, an observer at rest on the earth would not see the ball moving at nearly twice the speed of light. The
observer would see it moving at a speed that is still less than c. This result conforms to both of Einstein’s postulates: The speed of
light has a fixed maximum and neither reference frame is privileged.
Consider how we measure elapsed time. If we use a stopwatch, for example, how do we know when to start and stop the watch?
One method is to use the arrival of light from the event, such as observing a light turn green to start a drag race. The timing will
be more accurate if some sort of electronic detection is used, avoiding human reaction times and other complications.
Now suppose we use this method to measure the time interval between two flashes of light produced by flash lamps on a moving
train. (See Figure 10.4)

Chapter 10 • Special Relativity

Figure 10.4 Light arriving to observer A as seen by two different observers.

A woman (observer A) is seated in the center of a rail car, with two flash lamps at opposite sides equidistant from her. Multiple
light rays that are emitted from the flash lamps move towards observer A, as shown with arrows. A velocity vector arrow for the
rail car is shown towards the right. A man (observer B) standing on the platform is facing the woman and also observes the
flashes of light.
Observer A moves with the lamps on the rail car as the rail car moves towards the right of observer B. Observer B receives the
light flashes simultaneously, and sees the bulbs as both having flashed at the same time. However, he sees observer A receive the
flash from the right first. Because the pulse from the right reaches her first, in her frame of reference she sees the bulbs as not
having flashed simultaneously. Here, a relative velocity between observers affects whether two events at well-separated
locations are observed to be simultaneous. Simultaneity, or whether different events occur at the same instant, depends on the
frame of reference of the observer. Remember that velocity equals distance divided by time, so t = d/v. If velocity appears to be
different, then duration of time appears to be different.
This illustrates the power of clear thinking. We might have guessed incorrectly that, if light is emitted simultaneously, then two
observers halfway between the sources would see the flashes simultaneously. But careful analysis shows this not to be the case.
Einstein was brilliant at this type of thought experiment (in German, Gedankenexperiment). He very carefully considered how
an observation is made and disregarded what might seem obvious. The validity of thought experiments, of course, is
determined by actual observation. The genius of Einstein is evidenced by the fact that experiments have repeatedly confirmed
his theory of relativity. No experiments after that of Michelson and Morley were able to detect any ether medium. We will
describe later how experiments also confirmed other predictions of special relativity, such as the distance between two objects
and the time interval of two events being different for two observers moving with respect to each other.
In summary: Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as occurring at the same time (such as by
receiving light from the events). Two events are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers.

10.1 • Postulates of Special Relativity

The discrepancies between Newtonian mechanics and relativity theory illustrate an important point about how science
advances. Einstein’s theory did not replace Newton’s but rather extended it. It is not unusual that a new theory must be
developed to account for new information. In most cases, the new theory is built on the foundation of older theory. It is rare that
old theories are completely replaced.
In this chapter, you will learn about the theory of special relativity, but, as mentioned in the introduction, Einstein developed
two relativity theories: special and general. Table 10.1 summarizes the differences between the two theories.

Relativistic Effects on Time, Distance, and Momentum
Consideration of the measurement of elapsed time and simultaneity leads to an important relativistic effect. Time dilation is
the phenomenon of time passing more slowly for an observer who is moving relative to another observer.
For example, suppose an astronaut measures the time it takes for light to travel from the light source, cross her ship, bounce off
a mirror, and return. (See Figure 10.5.) How does the elapsed time the astronaut measures compare with the elapsed time
measured for the same event by a person on the earth? Asking this question (another thought experiment) produces a profound
result. We find that the elapsed time for a process depends on who is measuring it. In this case, the time measured by the
astronaut is smaller than the time measured by the earth bound observer. The passage of time is different for the two observers
because the distance the light travels in the astronaut’s frame is smaller than in the earth bound frame. Light travels at the same
speed in each frame, and so it will take longer to travel the greater distance in the earth bound frame.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

Try putting some values for v into the expression for the relativistic factor ( ). Observe at which speeds this factor will make
a difference and when is so close to 1 that it can be ignored. Try 225 m/s, the speed of an airliner; 2.98 × 104 m/s, the speed
of Earth in its orbit; and 2.990 × 108 m/s, the speed of a particle in an accelerator.
Notice that when the velocity v is small compared to the speed of light c, then v/c becomes small, and becomes close to 1. When
this happens, time measurements are the same in both frames of reference. Relativistic effects, meaning those that have to do
with special relativity, usually become significant when speeds become comparable to the speed of light. This is seen to be the
case for time dilation.
You may have seen science fiction movies in which space travelers return to Earth after a long trip to find that the planet and
everyone on it has aged much more than they have. This type of scenario is a based on a thought experiment, known as the twin
paradox, which imagines a pair of twins, one of whom goes on a trip into space while the other stays home. When the space
traveler returns, she finds her twin has aged much more than she. This happens because the traveling twin has been in two
frames of reference, one leaving Earth and one returning.
Time dilation has been confirmed by comparing the time recorded by an atomic clock sent into orbit to the time recorded by a
clock that remained on Earth. GPS satellites must also be adjusted to compensate for time dilation in order to give accurate
positioning.
Have you ever driven on a road, like that shown in Figure 10.6, that seems like it goes on forever? If you look ahead, you might
say you have about 10 km left to go. Another traveler might say the road ahead looks like it is about 15 km long. If you both
measured the road, however, you would agree. Traveling at everyday speeds, the distance you both measure would be the same.
You will read in this section, however, that this is not true at relativistic speeds. Close to the speed of light, distances measured
are not the same when measured by different observers moving with respect to one other.

Figure 10.6 People might describe distances differently, but at relativistic speeds, the distances really are different. (Corey Leopold, Flickr)

One thing all observers agree upon is their relative speed. When one observer is traveling away from another, they both see the
other receding at the same speed, regardless of whose frame of reference is chosen. Remember that speed equals distance
divided by time: v = d/t. If the observers experience a difference in elapsed time, they must also observe a difference in distance
traversed. This is because the ratio d/t must be the same for both observers.
The shortening of distance experienced by an observer moving with respect to the points whose distance apart is measured is
called length contraction. Proper length, L0, is the distance between two points measured in the reference frame where the
observer and the points are at rest. The observer in motion with respect to the points measures L. These two lengths are related
by the equation

Because is the same expression used in the time dilation equation above, the equation becomes

10.2 • Consequences of Special Relativity

To see how length contraction is seen by a moving observer, go to this simulation (http://openstax.org/l/28simultaneity) . Here
you can also see that simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction are interrelated phenomena.
This link is to a simulation that illustrates the relativity of simultaneous events.
In classical physics, momentum is a simple product of mass and velocity. When special relativity is taken into account, objects
that have mass have a speed limit. What effect do you think mass and velocity have on the momentum of objects moving at
relativistic speeds; i.e., speeds close to the speed of light?
Momentum is one of the most important concepts in physics. The broadest form of Newton’s second law is stated in terms of
momentum. Momentum is conserved in classical mechanics whenever the net external force on a system is zero. This makes
momentum conservation a fundamental tool for analyzing collisions. We will see that momentum has the same importance in
modern physics. Relativistic momentum is conserved, and much of what we know about subatomic structure comes from the
analysis of collisions of accelerator-produced relativistic particles.
One of the postulates of special relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Does the law of
conservation of momentum survive this requirement at high velocities? The answer is yes, provided that the momentum is
defined as follows.
Relativistic momentum, p, is classical momentum multiplied by the relativistic factor
10.3
where is the rest mass of the object (that is, the mass measured at rest, without any factor involved), is its velocity relative
to an observer, and as before, is the relativistic factor. We use the mass of the object as measured at rest because we cannot
determine its mass while it is moving.
Note that we use for velocity here to distinguish it from relative velocity between observers. Only one observer is being

considered here. With defined in this way,
Again we see that the relativistic quantity becomes virtually the same as the classical at low velocities. That is, relativistic
momentum
becomes the classical
at low velocities, because is very nearly equal to 1 at low velocities.
Relativistic momentum has the same intuitive feel as classical momentum. It is greatest for large masses moving at high
velocities. Because of the factor however, relativistic momentum behaves differently from classical momentum by
approaching infinity as approaches (See Figure 10.7.) This is another indication that an object with mass cannot reach the
speed of light. If it did, its momentum would become infinite, which is an unreasonable value.

Figure 10.7 Relativistic momentum approaches infinity as the velocity of an object approaches the speed of light.

Relativistic momentum is defined in such a way that the conservation of momentum will hold in all inertial frames. Whenever
the net external force on a system is zero, relativistic momentum is conserved, just as is the case for classical momentum. This

has been verified in numerous experiments.

Relativistic Energy
The original source of all the energy we use is the conversion of mass into energy. Most of this energy is generated by nuclear
reactions in the sun and radiated to Earth in the form of electromagnetic radiation, where it is then transformed into all the
forms with which we are familiar. The remaining energy from nuclear reactions is produced in nuclear power plants and in
Earth’s interior. In each of these cases, the source of the energy is the conversion of a small amount of mass into a large amount
of energy. These sources are shown in Figure 10.8.

Center, Scientific Visualization Studio; (b) U.S. government)

The first postulate of relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. Einstein showed that the law of
conservation of energy is valid relativistically, if we define energy to include a relativistic factor. The result of his analysis is that
a particle or object of mass m moving at velocity u has relativistic energy given by

This is the expression for the total energy of an object of mass m at any speed u and includes both kinetic and potential energy.
Look back at the equation for and you will see that it is equal to 1 when u is 0; that is, when an object is at rest. Then the rest

energy, E0, is simply

This is the correct form of Einstein’s famous equation.
This equation is very useful to nuclear physicists because it can be used to calculate the energy released by a nuclear reaction.
This is done simply by subtracting the mass of the products of such a reaction from the mass of the reactants. The difference is
Here is a simple example:
the m in
A positron is a type of antimatter that is just like an electron, except that it has a positive charge. When a positron and an
electron collide, their masses are completely annihilated and converted to energy in the form of gamma rays. Because both
particles have a rest mass of 9.11 × 10–31 kg, we multiply the mc2 term by 2. So the energy of the gamma rays is

where we have the expression for the joule (J) in terms of its SI base units of kg, m, and s. In general, the nuclei of stable isotopes
have less mass then their constituent subatomic particles. The energy equivalent of this difference is called the binding energy
of the nucleus. This energy is released during the formation of the isotope from its constituent particles because the product is
more stable than the reactants. Expressed as mass, it is called the mass defect. For example, a helium nucleus is made of two
neutrons and two protons and has a mass of 4.0003 atomic mass units (u). The sum of the masses of two protons and two
neutrons is 4.0330 u. The mass defect then is 0.0327 u. Converted to kg, the mass defect is 5.0442 × 10–30 kg. Multiplying this
mass times c2 gives a binding energy of 4.540 × 10–12 J. This does not sound like much because it is only one atom. If you were to
make one gram of helium out of neutrons and protons, it would release 683,000,000,000 J. By comparison, burning one gram of
coal releases about 24 J.

BOUNDLESS PHYSICS
The RHIC Collider

Figure 10.9 shows the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, NY. The circular structure houses a particle accelerator called
the RHIC, which stands for Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The heavy ions in the name are gold nuclei that have been stripped of
their electrons. Streams of ions are accelerated in several stages before entering the big ring seen in the figure. Here, they are
accelerated to their final speed, which is about 99.7 percent the speed of light. Such high speeds are called relativistic. All the
relativistic phenomena we have been discussing in this chapter are very pronounced in this case. At this speed = 12.9, so that
relativistic time dilates by a factor of about 13, and relativistic length contracts by the same factor.

Figure 10.9 Brookhaven National Laboratory. The circular structure houses the RHIC. (energy.gov, Wikimedia Commons)

Two ion beams circle the 2.4-mile long track around the big ring in opposite directions. The paths can then be made to cross,
thereby causing ions to collide. The collision event is very short-lived but amazingly intense. The temperatures and pressures
produced are greater than those in the hottest suns. At 4 trillion degrees Celsius, this is the hottest material ever created in a

laboratory
But what is the point of creating such an extreme event? Under these conditions, the neutrons and protons that make up the
gold nuclei are smashed apart into their components, which are called quarks and gluons. The goal is to recreate the conditions
that theorists believe existed at the very beginning of the universe. It is thought that, at that time, matter was a sort of soup of
quarks and gluons. When things cooled down after the initial bang, these particles condensed to form protons and neutrons.
Some of the results have been surprising and unexpected. It was thought the quark-gluon soup would resemble a gas or plasma.
Instead, it behaves more like a liquid. It has been called a perfect liquid because it has virtually no viscosity, meaning that it has
no resistance to flow.

WORKED EXAMPLE
The Speed of Light

One night you are out looking up at the stars and an extraterrestrial spaceship flashes across the sky. The ship is 50 meters long
and is travelling at 95 percent of the speed of light. What would the ship’s length be when measured from your earthbound
frame of reference?
Strategy
List the knowns and unknowns.
Knowns: proper length of the ship, L0 = 50 m; velocity, v, = 0.95c
Unknowns: observed length of the ship accounting for relativistic length contraction, L.
Choose the relevant equation.

Solution

Discussion
Calculations of can usually be simplified in this way when v is expressed as a percentage of c because the c2 terms cancel. Be
sure to also square the decimal representing the percentage before subtracting from 1. Note that the aliens will still see the
length as L0 because they are moving with the frame of reference that is the ship.

Extended Response
10.1 Postulates of Special Relativity
34. Explain how Einstein’s conclusion that nothing can
travel faster than the speed of light contradicts an older
concept about the speed of an object propelled from
another, already moving, object.

example, if a person throws a ball while running,
the speed of the ball relative to the ground is the

b. False
32. Explain why the special theory of relativity caused the
law of conservation of energy to be modified.
a. The law of conservation of energy is not valid in
relativistic mechanics.
b. The law of conservation of energy has to be
modified because of time dilation.
c. The law of conservation of energy has to be

d. The law of conservation of energy has to be
modified because of mass-energy equivalence.
33. The sun loses about 4 × 109 kg of mass every second.
Explain in terms of special relativity why this is
happening.
a. The sun loses mass because of its high temperature.
b. The sun loses mass because it is continuously
releasing energy.
c. The Sun loses mass because the diameter of the sun
is contracted.
d. The sun loses mass because the speed of the sun is
very high and close to the speed of light.

speed at which the person was running minus the
speed of the throw. A relativistic example is when
light is emitted from car headlights, it moves faster
than the speed of light emitted from a stationary
source.
b. The older concept is that speeds are additive. For
example, if a person throws a ball while running,
the speed of the ball relative to the ground is the
speed at which the person was running plus the
speed of the throw. A relativistic example is when
light is emitted from car headlights, it moves no

326

faster than the speed of light emitted from a
stationary source. The car's speed does not affect
the speed of light.
c. The older concept is that speeds are multiplicative.
For example, if a person throws a ball while
running, the speed of the ball relative to the ground
is the speed at which the person was running
multiplied by the speed of the throw. A relativistic
example is when light is emitted from car
headlights, it moves no faster than the speed of
light emitted from a stationary source. The car's
speed does not affect the speed of light.
d. The older concept is that speeds are frame
independent. For example, if a person throws a ball
while running, the speed of the ball relative to the
ground has nothing to do with the speed at which
the person was running. A relativistic example is
when light is emitted from car headlights, it moves
no faster than the speed of light emitted from a
stationary source. The car's speed does not affect
the speed of light.

11.3 Phase Change and Latent Heat

INTRODUCTION Heat is something familiar to all of us. We feel the warmth of the summer sun, the hot vapor rising up out of
a cup of hot cocoa, and the cooling effect of our sweat. When we feel warmth, it means that heat is transferring energy to our
bodies; when we feel cold, that means heat is transferring energy away from our bodies. Heat transfer is the movement of
thermal energy from one place or material to another, and is caused by temperature differences. For example, much of our
weather is caused by Earth evening out the temperature across the planet through wind and violent storms, which are driven by
heat transferring energy away from the equator towards the cold poles. In this chapter, we’ll explore the precise meaning of heat,
how it relates to temperature as well as to other forms of energy, and its connection to work.

Temperature
What is temperature? It’s one of those concepts so ingrained in our everyday lives that, although we know what it means
intuitively, it can be hard to define. It is tempting to say that temperature measures heat, but this is not strictly true. Heat is the
transfer of energy due to a temperature difference. Temperature is defined in terms of the instrument we use to tell us how hot
or cold an object is, based on a mechanism and scale invented by people. Temperature is literally defined as what we measure on
a thermometer.
Heat is often confused with temperature. For example, we may say that the heat was unbearable, when we actually mean that
the temperature was high. This is because we are sensitive to the flow of energy by heat, rather than the temperature. Since heat,
like work, transfers energy, it has the SI unit of joule (J).
Atoms and molecules are constantly in motion, bouncing off one another in random directions. Recall that kinetic energy is the
energy of motion, and that it increases in proportion to velocity squared. Without going into mathematical detail, we can say
that thermal energy—the energy associated with heat—is the average kinetic energy of the particles (molecules or atoms) in a
substance. Faster moving molecules have greater kinetic energies, and so the substance has greater thermal energy, and thus a
higher temperature. The total internal energy of a system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of its atoms and
molecules. Thermal energy is one of the subcategories of internal energy, as is chemical energy.
To measure temperature, some scale must be used as a standard of measurement. The three most commonly used temperature
scales are the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scales. Both the Fahrenheit scale and Celsius scale are relative temperature scales,
meaning that they are made around a reference point. For example, the Celsius scale uses the freezing point of water as its
reference point; all measurements are either lower than the freezing point of water by a given number of degrees (and have a
negative sign), or higher than the freezing point of water by a given number of degrees (and have a positive sign). The boiling

this scale is the degree Fahrenheit
for the Fahrenheit scale than for the Celsius scale. Therefore, a temperature difference of one degree Celsius is greater than a
temperature difference of one degree Fahrenheit. Since 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180 Fahrenheit degrees, one
degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times larger than one degree on the Fahrenheit scale (because

relationship can be used to convert between temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius (see Figure 11.2).

sizes of the scales are also shown.

The Kelvin scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science because it is an absolute temperature scale. This
means that the theoretically lowest-possible temperature is assigned the value of zero. Zero degrees on the Kelvin scale is known
as absolute zero; it is theoretically the point at which there is no molecular motion to produce thermal energy. On the original
Kelvin scale first created by Lord Kelvin, all temperatures have positive values, making it useful for scientific work. The official
temperature unit on this scale is the kelvin, which is abbreviated as K. The freezing point of water is 273.15 K, and the boiling
point of water is 373.15 K.
Although absolute zero is possible in theory, it cannot be reached in practice. The lowest temperature ever created and measured
K, at Helsinki University of Technology in Finland. In comparison, the coldest
during a laboratory experiment was
recorded temperature for a place on Earth’s surface was 183 K (–89 °C ), at Vostok, Antarctica, and the coldest known place

Even without the number labels on the thermometer, you could tell which side is marked Fahrenheit and which is Celsius by
how the degree marks are spaced. Why?
a. The separation between two consecutive divisions on the Fahrenheit scale is greater than a similar separation on the

degrees Celsius.

While the Fahrenheit scale is still the most commonly used scale in the United States, the majority of the world uses Celsius, and
scientists prefer Kelvin. It’s often necessary to convert between these scales. For instance, if the TV meteorologist gave the local
weather report in kelvins, there would likely be some confused viewers! Table 11.1 gives the equations for conversion between the

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Sometimes it is not so easy to guess the temperature of the air accurately. Why is this? Factors such as humidity and wind
speed affect how hot or cold we feel. Wind removes thermal energy from our bodies at a faster rate than usual, making us
feel colder than we otherwise would; on a cold day, you may have heard the TV weather person refer to the wind chill.
On humid summer days, people tend to feel hotter because sweat doesn’t evaporate from the skin as efficiently as it does on
dry days, when the evaporation of sweat cools us off.

Heat Transfer, Specific Heat, and Heat Capacity
We learned in the previous section that temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in a
substance, and that the average internal kinetic energy of a substance is higher when the substance’s temperature is higher.
If two objects at different temperatures are brought in contact with each other, energy is transferred from the hotter object (that
is, the object with the greater temperature) to the colder (lower temperature) object, until both objects are at the same
temperature. There is no net heat transfer once the temperatures are equal because the amount of heat transferred from one
object to the other is the same as the amount of heat returned. One of the major effects of heat transfer is temperature change:
Heating increases the temperature while cooling decreases it. Experiments show that the heat transferred to or from a
substance depends on three factors—the change in the substance’s temperature, the mass of the substance, and certain physical
properties related to the phase of the substance.
The equation for heat transfer Q is
11.7
where m is the mass of the substance and ΔT is the change in its temperature, in units of Celsius or Kelvin. The symbol c stands
for specific heat, and depends on the material and phase. The specific heat is the amount of heat necessary to change the
temperature of 1.00 kg of mass by 1.00 ºC. The specific heat c is a property of the substance; its SI unit is J/(kg K) or J/(kg
).
The temperature change (
) is the same in units of kelvins and degrees Celsius (but not degrees Fahrenheit). Specific heat is
closely related to the concept of heat capacity. Heat capacity is the amount of heat necessary to change the temperature of a
. In equation form, heat capacity C is
, where m is mass and c is specific heat. Note that heat
substance by 1.00
capacity is the same as specific heat, but without any dependence on mass. Consequently, two objects made up of the same
material but with different masses will have different heat capacities. This is because the heat capacity is a property of an object,
but specific heat is a property of any object made of the same material.
Values of specific heat must be looked up in tables, because there is no simple way to calculate them. Table 11.2 gives the values
of specific heat for a few substances as a handy reference. We see from this table that the specific heat of water is five times that
of glass, which means that it takes five times as much heat to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water than to raise the temperature
of 1 kg of glass by the same number of degrees.

Conduction, Convection, and Radiation
Whenever there is a temperature difference, heat transfer occurs. Heat transfer may happen rapidly, such as through a cooking
pan, or slowly, such as through the walls of an insulated cooler.
There are three different heat transfer methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. At times, all three may happen
simultaneously. See Figure 11.3.

Access for free at openstax.org.

11.2 • Heat, Specific Heat, and Heat Transfer

Figure 11.3 In a fireplace, heat transfer occurs by all three methods: conduction, convection, and radiation. Radiation is responsible for
most of the heat transferred into the room. Heat transfer also occurs through conduction into the room, but at a much slower rate. Heat
transfer by convection also occurs through cold air entering the room around windows and hot air leaving the room by rising up the
chimney.

Conduction is heat transfer through direct physical contact. Heat transferred between the electric burner of a stove and the
bottom of a pan is transferred by conduction. Sometimes, we try to control the conduction of heat to make ourselves more
comfortable. Since the rate of heat transfer is different for different materials, we choose fabrics, such as a thick wool sweater,
that slow down the transfer of heat away from our bodies in winter.
As you walk barefoot across the living room carpet, your feet feel relatively comfortable…until you step onto the kitchen’s tile
floor. Since the carpet and tile floor are both at the same temperature, why does one feel colder than the other? This is explained
by different rates of heat transfer: The tile material removes heat from your skin at a greater rate than the carpeting, which
makes it feel colder.
Some materials simply conduct thermal energy faster than others. In general, metals (like copper, aluminum, gold, and silver)
are good heat conductors, whereas materials like wood, plastic, and rubber are poor heat conductors.
Figure 11.4 shows particles (either atoms or molecules) in two bodies at different temperatures. The (average) kinetic energy of a
particle in the hot body is higher than in the colder body. If two particles collide, energy transfers from the particle with greater
kinetic energy to the particle with less kinetic energy. When two bodies are in contact, many particle collisions occur, resulting
in a net flux of heat from the higher-temperature body to the lower-temperature body. The heat flux depends on the

Figure 11.4 The particles in two bodies at different temperatures have different average kinetic energies. Collisions occurring at the contact
surface tend to transfer energy from high-temperature regions to low-temperature regions. In this illustration, a particle in the lowertemperature region (right side) has low kinetic energy before collision, but its kinetic energy increases after colliding with the contact

surface. In contrast, a particle in the higher-temperature region (left side) has more kinetic energy before collision, but its energy decreases
after colliding with the contact surface.

Convection is heat transfer by the movement of a fluid. This type of heat transfer happens, for example, in a pot boiling on the
stove, or in thunderstorms, where hot air rises up to the base of the clouds.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

In everyday language, the term fluid is usually taken to mean liquid. For example, when you are sick and the doctor tells you
to “push fluids,” that only means to drink more beverages—not to breath more air. However, in physics, fluid means a liquid
or a gas. Fluids move differently than solid material, and even have their own branch of physics, known as fluid dynamics,
that studies how they move.
As the temperature of fluids increase, they expand and become less dense. For example, Figure 11.4 could represent the wall of a
balloon with different temperature gases inside the balloon than outside in the environment. The hotter and thus faster moving
gas particles inside the balloon strike the surface with more force than the cooler air outside, causing the balloon to expand. This
decrease in density relative to its environment creates buoyancy (the tendency to rise). Convection is driven by buoyancy—hot
air rises because it is less dense than the surrounding air.
Sometimes, we control the temperature of our homes or ourselves by controlling air movement. Sealing leaks around doors with
weather stripping keeps out the cold wind in winter. The house in Figure 11.5 and the pot of water on the stove in Figure 11.6 are
both examples of convection and buoyancy by human design. Ocean currents and large-scale atmospheric circulation transfer
energy from one part of the globe to another, and are examples of natural convection.

Figure 11.5 Air heated by the so-called gravity furnace expands and rises, forming a convective loop that transfers energy to other parts of
the room. As the air is cooled at the ceiling and outside walls, it contracts, eventually becoming denser than room air and sinking to the
floor. A properly designed heating system like this one, which uses natural convection, can be quite efficient in uniformly heating a home.

Figure 11.6 Convection plays an important role in heat transfer inside this pot of water. Once conducted to the inside fluid, heat transfer to
other parts of the pot is mostly by convection. The hotter water expands, decreases in density, and rises to transfer heat to other regions of
the water, while colder water sinks to the bottom. This process repeats as long as there is water in the pot.

Radiation is a form of heat transfer that occurs when electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed. Electromagnetic

Access for free at openstax.org.

11.2 • Heat, Specific Heat, and Heat Transfer

radiation includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays, all
of which have different wavelengths and amounts of energy (shorter wavelengths have higher frequency and more energy).
You can feel the heat transfer from a fire and from the sun. Similarly, you can sometimes tell that the oven is hot without
touching its door or looking inside—it may just warm you as you walk by. Another example is thermal radiation from the human
body; people are constantly emitting infrared radiation, which is not visible to the human eye, but is felt as heat.
Radiation is the only method of heat transfer where no medium is required, meaning that the heat doesn’t need to come into
direct contact with or be transported by any matter. The space between Earth and the sun is largely empty, without any
possibility of heat transfer by convection or conduction. Instead, heat is transferred by radiation, and Earth is warmed as it
absorbs electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun.

Figure 11.7 Most of the heat transfer from this fire to the observers is through infrared radiation. The visible light transfers relatively little
thermal energy. Since skin is very sensitive to infrared radiation, you can sense the presence of a fire without looking at it directly. (Daniel X.
O’Neil)

All objects absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation (see Figure 11.7). The rate of heat transfer by radiation depends mainly on
the color of the object. Black is the most effective absorber and radiator, and white is the least effective. People living in hot
climates generally avoid wearing black clothing, for instance. Similarly, black asphalt in a parking lot will be hotter than
adjacent patches of grass on a summer day, because black absorbs better than green. The reverse is also true—black radiates
better than green. On a clear summer night, the black asphalt will be colder than the green patch of grass, because black radiates
energy faster than green. In contrast, white is a poor absorber and also a poor radiator. A white object reflects nearly all
radiation, like a mirror.

because the specific heat of water is over four times greater than the specific heat of aluminum. Therefore, it takes a bit more
than twice as much heat to achieve the given temperature change for the water than for the aluminum pan.
Water can absorb a tremendous amount of energy with very little resulting temperature change. This property of water allows
for life on Earth because it stabilizes temperatures. Other planets are less habitable because wild temperature swings make for a
harsh environment. You may have noticed that climates closer to large bodies of water, such as oceans, are milder than climates
landlocked in the middle of a large continent. This is due to the climate-moderating effect of water’s large heat capacity—water
stores large amounts of heat during hot weather and releases heat gradually when it’s cold outside.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating Temperature Increase: Truck Brakes Overheat on Downhill Runs

When a truck headed downhill brakes, the brakes must do work to convert the gravitational potential energy of the truck to
internal energy of the brakes. This conversion prevents the gravitational potential energy from being converted into kinetic
energy of the truck, and keeps the truck from speeding up and losing control. The increased internal energy of the brakes raises
their temperature. When the hill is especially steep, the temperature increase may happen too quickly and cause the brakes to
overheat.
from a 10,000 kg
Calculate the temperature increase of 100 kg of brake material with an average specific heat of 800 J/kg
truck descending 75.0 m (in vertical displacement) at a constant speed.

STRATEGY
We first calculate the gravitational potential energy (Mgh) of the truck, and then find the temperature increase produced in the
brakes.
Solution
1. Calculate the change in gravitational potential energy as the truck goes downhill.
11.15
2. Calculate the temperature change from the heat transferred by rearranging the equation

to solve for
11.16

where m is the mass of the brake material (not the entire truck). Insert the values Q = 7.35×106 J (since the heat transfer is
equal to the change in gravitational potential energy), m 100 kg, and c 800 J/kg
to find
11.17
Discussion
This temperature is close to the boiling point of water. If the truck had been traveling for some time, then just before the
descent, the brake temperature would likely be higher than the ambient temperature. The temperature increase in the descent
would likely raise the temperature of the brake material above the boiling point of water, which would be hard on the brakes.
This is why truck drivers sometimes use a different technique for called “engine braking” to avoid burning their brakes during
steep descents. Engine braking is using the slowing forces of an engine in low gear rather than brakes to slow down.

11.3 • Phase Change and Latent Heat

Phase Changes
So far, we have learned that adding thermal energy by heat increases the temperature of a substance. But surprisingly, there are
situations where adding energy does not change the temperature of a substance at all! Instead, the additional thermal energy
acts to loosen bonds between molecules or atoms and causes a phase change. Because this energy enters or leaves a system
during a phase change without causing a temperature change in the system, it is known as latent heat (latent means hidden).
The three phases of matter that you frequently encounter are solid, liquid and gas (see Figure 11.8). Solid has the least energetic
state; atoms in solids are in close contact, with forces between them that allow the particles to vibrate but not change position
with neighboring particles. (These forces can be thought of as springs that can be stretched or compressed, but not easily
broken.)
Liquid has a more energetic state, in which particles can slide smoothly past one another and change neighbors, although they
are still held together by their mutual attraction.
Gas has a more energetic state than liquid, in which particles are broken free of their bonds. Particles in gases are separated by
distances that are large compared with the size of the particles.
The most energetic state of all is plasma. Although you may not have heard much about plasma, it is actually the most common
state of matter in the universe—stars are made up of plasma, as is lightning. The plasma state is reached by heating a gas to the
point where particles are pulled apart, separating the electrons from the rest of the particle. This produces an ionized gas that is
a combination of the negatively charged free electrons and positively charged ions, known as plasma.

Figure 11.8 (a) Particles in a solid always have the same neighbors, held close by forces represented here by springs. These particles are
essentially in contact with one another. A rock is an example of a solid. This rock retains its shape because of the forces holding its atoms or
molecules together. (b) Particles in a liquid are also in close contact but can slide over one another. Forces between them strongly resist
attempts to push them closer together and also hold them in close contact. Water is an example of a liquid. Water can flow, but it also
remains in an open container because of the forces between its molecules. (c) Particles in a gas are separated by distances that are
considerably larger than the size of the particles themselves, and they move about freely. A gas must be held in a closed container to
prevent it from moving out into its surroundings. (d) The atmosphere is ionized in the extreme heat of a lightning strike.

During a phase change, matter changes from one phase to another, either through the addition of energy by heat and the
transition to a more energetic state, or from the removal of energy by heat and the transition to a less energetic state.
Phase changes to a more energetic state include the following:
• Melting—Solid to liquid
• Vaporization—Liquid to gas (included boiling and evaporation)
• Sublimation—Solid to gas
Phase changes to a less energetic state are as follows:
• Condensation—Gas to liquid
• Freezing—Liquid to solid
Energy is required to melt a solid because the bonds between the particles in the solid must be broken. Since the energy involved
in a phase changes is used to break bonds, there is no increase in the kinetic energies of the particles, and therefore no rise in
temperature. Similarly, energy is needed to vaporize a liquid to overcome the attractive forces between particles in the liquid.
There is no temperature change until a phase change is completed. The temperature of a cup of soda and ice that is initially at 0
stays at 0
until all of the ice has melted. In the reverse of these processes—freezing and condensation—energy is released

341

Chapter 11 • Thermal Energy, Heat, and Work

from the latent heat (see Figure 11.9).

Figure 11.9 (a) Energy is required to partially overcome the attractive forces between particles in a solid to form a liquid. That same energy
must be removed for freezing to take place. (b) Particles are separated by large distances when changing from liquid to vapor, requiring
significant energy to overcome molecular attraction. The same energy must be removed for condensation to take place. There is no
temperature change until a phase change is completed. (c) Enough energy is added that the liquid state is skipped over completely as a
substance undergoes sublimation.

Table 11.3 Latent Heats of Fusion and Vaporization, along with Melting and Boiling Points
Let’s consider the example of adding heat to ice to examine its transitions through all three phases—solid to liquid to gas. A
phase diagram indicating the temperature changes of water as energy is added is shown in Figure 11.10. The ice starts out at −20
, and its temperature rises linearly, absorbing heat at a constant rate until it reaches 0 Once at this temperature, the ice
during this phase change. Once all the ice has
gradually melts, absorbing 334 kJ/kg. The temperature remains constant at 0
melted, the temperature of the liquid water rises, absorbing heat at a new constant rate. At 100 , the water begins to boil and
the temperature again remains constant while the water absorbs 2256 kJ/kg during this phase change. When all the liquid has
become steam, the temperature rises again at a constant rate.

Chapter 11 • Thermal Energy, Heat, and Work

Figure 11.10 A graph of temperature versus added energy. The system is constructed so that no vapor forms while ice warms to become
liquid water, and so when vaporization occurs, the vapor remains in the system. The long stretches of constant temperature values at 0
and 100

reflect the large latent heats of melting and vaporization, respectively.

We have seen that vaporization requires heat transfer to a substance from its surroundings. Condensation is the reverse
process, where heat in transferred away from a substance to its surroundings. This release of latent heat increases the
temperature of the surroundings. Energy must be removed from the condensing particles to make a vapor condense. This is why
condensation occurs on cold surfaces: the heat transfers energy away from the warm vapor to the cold surface. The energy is
exactly the same as that required to cause the phase change in the other direction, from liquid to vapor, and so it can be
calculated from
. Latent heat is also released into the environment when a liquid freezes, and can be calculated from
.

Ice cream is certainly easy enough to buy at the supermarket, but for the hardcore ice cream enthusiast, that may not be
satisfying enough. Going through the process of making your own ice cream lets you invent your own flavors and marvel at the
physics firsthand (Figure 11.11).
The first step to making homemade ice cream is to mix heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, and your flavor of choice; it could be as

simple as cocoa powder or vanilla extract, or as fancy as pomegranates or pistachios.
The next step is to pour the mixture into a container that is deep enough that you will be able to churn the mixture without it
spilling over, and that is also freezer-safe. After placing it in the freezer, the ice cream has to be stirred vigorously every 45
minutes for four to five hours. This slows the freezing process and prevents the ice cream from turning into a solid block of ice.
Most people prefer a soft creamy texture instead of one giant popsicle.
As it freezes, the cream undergoes a phase change from liquid to solid. By now, we’re experienced enough to know that this
means that the cream must experience a loss of heat. Where does that heat go? Due to the temperature difference between the
freezer and the ice cream mixture, heat transfers thermal energy from the ice cream to the air in the freezer. Once the
temperature in the freezer rises enough, the freezer is cooled by pumping excess heat outside into the kitchen.
A faster way to make ice cream is to chill it by placing the mixture in a plastic bag, surrounded by another plastic bag half full of
ice. (You can also add a teaspoon of salt to the outer bag to lower the temperature of the ice/salt mixture.) Shaking the bag for
five minutes churns the ice cream while cooling it evenly. In this case, the heat transfers energy out of the ice cream mixture and
into the ice during the phase change.
This video (http://www.openstax.org/l/28icecream) gives a demonstration of how to make home-made ice cream using ice and
plastic bags.
GRASP CHECK
Why does the ice bag method work so much faster than the freezer method for making ice cream?
a. Ice has a smaller specific heat than the surrounding air in a freezer. Hence, it absorbs more energy from the ice-cream
mixture.
b. Ice has a smaller specific heat than the surrounding air in a freezer. Hence, it absorbs less energy from the ice-cream
mixture.
c. Ice has a greater specific heat than the surrounding air in a freezer. Hence, it absorbs more energy from the ice-cream
mixture.
d. Ice has a greater specific heat than the surrounding air in a freezer. Hence, it absorbs less energy from the ice-cream
mixture.

Discussion
The amount of energy need to melt a kilogram of ice (334 kJ) is the same amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of
1.000 kg of liquid water from 0
to 79.8
. This example shows that the energy for a phase change is enormous compared to
energy associated with temperature changes. It also demonstrates that the amount of energy needed for vaporization is even
greater.

and the total mass of the ice
Ice cubes are used to chill a soda at 20
cubes is 0.018 kg. Assume that the soda is kept in a foam container so that heat loss can be ignored, and that the soda has the
same specific heat as water. Find the final temperature when all of the ice has melted.
STRATEGY
The ice cubes are at the melting temperature of 0
. Heat is transferred from the soda to the ice for melting. Melting of ice
occurs in two steps: first, the phase change occurs and solid (ice) transforms into liquid water at the melting temperature; then,
the temperature of this water rises. Melting yields water at 0 , so more heat is transferred from the soda to this water until
they are the same temperature. Since the amount of heat leaving the soda is the same as the amount of heat transferred to the
ice.
11.20
The heat transferred to the ice goes partly toward the phase change (melting), and partly toward raising the temperature after
melting. Recall from the last section that the relationship between heat and temperature change is

temperature change is

Discussion
This example shows the enormous energies involved during a phase change. The mass of the ice is about 7 percent the mass of
the soda, yet it causes a noticeable change in the soda’s temperature.
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
If the ice were not already at the freezing point, we would also have to factor in how much energy would go into raising its
temperature up to 0 , before the phase change occurs. This would be a realistic scenario, because the temperature of ice is
often below 0

INTRODUCTION Energy can be transferred to or from a system, either through a temperature difference between it and
another system (i.e., by heat) or by exerting a force through a distance (work). In these ways, energy can be converted into other
forms of energy in other systems. For example, a car engine burns fuel for heat transfer into a gas. Work is done by the gas as it
exerts a force through a distance by pushing a piston outward. This work converts the energy into a variety of other forms—into
an increase in the car’s kinetic or gravitational potential energy; into electrical energy to run the spark plugs, radio, and lights;
and back into stored energy in the car’s battery. But most of the thermal energy transferred by heat from the fuel burning in the
engine does not do work on the gas. Instead, much of this energy is released into the surroundings at lower temperature (i.e.,
lost through heat), which is quite inefficient. Car engines are only about 25 to 30 percent efficient. This inefficiency leads to
increased fuel costs, so there is great interest in improving fuel efficiency. However, it is common knowledge that modern
gasoline engines cannot be made much more efficient. The same is true about the conversion to electrical energy in large power
stations, whether they are coal, oil, natural gas, or nuclear powered. Why is this the case?
The answer lies in the nature of heat. Basic physical laws govern how heat transfer for doing work takes place and limit the

maximum possible efficiency of the process. This chapter will explore these laws as well their applications to everyday machines.
These topics are part of thermodynamics—the study of heat and its relationship to doing work.

12.1 Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics: Thermal Equilibrium
Section Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Explain the zeroth law of thermodynamics

Section Key Terms
thermal equilibrium

zeroth law of thermodynamics

We learned in the previous chapter that when two objects (or systems) are in contact with one another, heat will transfer thermal
energy from the object at higher temperature to the one at lower temperature until they both reach the same temperature. The
objects are then in thermal equilibrium, and no further temperature changes will occur if they are isolated from other systems.
The systems interact and change because their temperatures are different, and the changes stop once their temperatures are the
same. Thermal equilibrium is established when two bodies are in thermal contact with each other—meaning heat transfer (i.e.,
the transfer of energy by heat) can occur between them. If two systems cannot freely exchange energy, they will not reach
thermal equilibrium. (It is fortunate that empty space stands between Earth and the sun, because a state of thermal equilibrium
with the sun would be too toasty for life on this planet!)
If two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each another, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C,
then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. This statement may seem obvious, because all three have the same temperature,
but it is basic to thermodynamics. It is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
The zeroth law of thermodynamics is very similar to the transitive property of equality in mathematics: If a = b and b =
c, then a = c.
You may be wondering at this point, why the wacky name? Shouldn’t this be called the first law of thermodynamics rather than
the zeroth? The explanation is that this law was discovered after the first and second laws of thermodynamics but is so
fundamental that scientists decided it should logically come first.
As an example of the zeroth law in action, consider newborn babies in neonatal intensive-care units in hospitals. Prematurely
born or sick newborns are placed in special incubators. These babies have very little covering while in the incubators, so to an
observer, they look as though they may not be warm enough. However, inside the incubator, the temperature of the air, the cot,
and the baby are all the same—that is, they are in thermal equilibrium. The ambient temperature is just high enough to keep the
baby safe and comfortable.

Thermodynamics Engineer

Thermodynamics engineers apply the principles of thermodynamics to mechanical systems so as to create or test products that
rely on the interactions between heat, work, pressure, temperature, and volume. This type of work typically takes place in the
aerospace industry, chemical manufacturing companies, industrial manufacturing plants, power plants (Figure 12.2), engine
manufacturers, or electronics companies.

Figure 12.2 An engineer makes a site visit to the Baghdad South power plant.

The need for energy creates quite a bit of demand for thermodynamics engineers, because both traditional energy companies
and alternative (green) energy startups rely on interactions between heat and work and so require the expertise of
thermodynamics engineers. Traditional energy companies use mainly nuclear energy and energy from burning fossil fuels, such
as coal. Alternative energy is finding new ways to harness renewable and, often, more readily available energy sources, such as
solar, water, wind, and bio-energy.
A thermodynamics engineer in the energy industry can find the most efficient way to turn the burning of a biofuel or fossil fuel
into energy, store that energy for times when it’s needed most, or figure out how to best deliver that energy from where it’s
produced to where it’s used: in homes, factories, and businesses. Additionally, he or she might also design pollution-control
equipment to remove harmful pollutants from the smoke produced as a by-product of burning fuel. For example, a
thermodynamics engineer may develop a way to remove mercury from burning coal in a coal-fired power plant.
Thermodynamics engineering is an expanding field, where employment opportunities are expected to grow by as much as 27
percent between 2012 and 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. To become a thermodynamics engineer, you
must have a college degree in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, environmental engineering, aerospace
engineering, civil engineering, or biological engineering (depending on which type of career you wish to pursue), with
coursework in physics and physical chemistry that focuses on thermodynamics.

Pressure, Volume, Temperature, and the Ideal Gas Law
Before covering the first law of thermodynamics, it is first important to understand the relationship between pressure, volume,
and temperature. Pressure, P, is defined as
12.1
where F is a force applied to an area, A, that is perpendicular to the force.
Depending on the area over which it is exerted, a given force can have a significantly different effect, as shown in Figure 12.3.

Figure 12.3 (a) Although the person being poked with the finger might be irritated, the force has little lasting effect. (b) In contrast, the
same force applied to an area the size of the sharp end of a needle is great enough to break the skin.

The SI unit for pressure is the pascal, where
Pressure is defined for all states of matter but is particularly important when discussing fluids (such as air). You have probably
heard the word pressure being used in relation to blood (high or low blood pressure) and in relation to the weather (high- and
low-pressure weather systems). These are only two of many examples of pressures in fluids.
The relationship between the pressure, volume, and temperature for an ideal gas is given by the ideal gas law. A gas is
considered ideal at low pressure and fairly high temperature, and forces between its component particles can be ignored. The
ideal gas law states that
12.2
where P is the pressure of a gas, V is the volume it occupies, N is the number of particles (atoms or molecules) in the gas, and T is

12.2 • First law of Thermodynamics: Thermal Energy and Work

its absolute temperature. The constant k is called the Boltzmann constant and has the value
For the
purposes of this chapter, we will not go into calculations using the ideal gas law. Instead, it is important for us to notice from the
equation that the following are true for a given mass of gas:
• When volume is constant, pressure is directly proportional to temperature.
• When temperature is constant, pressure is inversely proportional to volume.
• When pressure is constant, volume is directly proportional to temperature.
This last point describes thermal expansion—the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature. What is the
underlying cause of thermal expansion? An increase in temperature means that there’s an increase in the kinetic energy of the
individual atoms. Gases are especially affected by thermal expansion, although liquids expand to a lesser extent with similar
increases in temperature, and even solids have minor expansions at higher temperatures. This is why railroad tracks and bridges
have expansion joints that allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes.
To get some idea of how pressure, temperature, and volume of a gas are related to one another, consider what happens when
you pump air into a deflated tire. The tire’s volume first increases in direct proportion to the amount of air injected, without
much increase in the tire pressure. Once the tire has expanded to nearly its full size, the walls limit volume expansion. If you
continue to pump air into tire (which now has a nearly constant volume), the pressure increases with increasing temperature
(see Figure 12.4).

Figure 12.4 (a) When air is pumped into a deflated tire, its volume first increases without much increase in pressure. (b) When the tire is
filled to a certain point, the tire walls resist further expansion, and the pressure increases as more air is added. (c) Once the tire is inflated
fully, its pressure increases with temperature.

Pressure–Volume Work
Pressure–volume work is the work that is done by the compression or expansion of a fluid. Whenever there is a change in
volume and external pressure remains constant, pressure–volume work is taking place. During a compression, a decrease in
volume increases the internal pressure of a system as work is done on the system. During an expansion (Figure 12.5), an increase
in volume decreases the internal pressure of a system as the system does work.

Recall that the formula for work is
in terms of pressure.

We can rearrange the definition of pressure,

to get an expression for force

Substituting this expression for force into the definition of work, we get

Just as we say that work is force acting over a distance, for fluids, we can say that work is the pressure acting through the change
in volume. For pressure–volume work, pressure is analogous to force, and volume is analogous to distance in the traditional
definition of work.

12.2 • First law of Thermodynamics: Thermal Energy and Work

by temperature differences, while work involves a force exerted through a distance. Nevertheless, heat and work can produce
identical results. For example, both can cause a temperature increase. Heat transfers energy into a system, such as when the sun
warms the air in a bicycle tire and increases the air’s temperature. Similarly, work can be done on the system, as when the
bicyclist pumps air into the tire. Once the temperature increase has occurred, it is impossible to tell whether it was caused by
heat or work. Heat and work are both energy in transit—neither is stored as such in a system. However, both can change the
internal energy, U, of a system.
Internal energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of a system’s atoms and molecules. It can be divided into many
subcategories, such as thermal and chemical energy, and depends only on the state of a system (that is, P, V, and T), not on how
the energy enters or leaves the system.
In order to understand the relationship between heat, work, and internal energy, we use the first law of thermodynamics. The
first law of thermodynamics applies the conservation of energy principle to systems where heat and work are the methods of
transferring energy into and out of the systems. It can also be used to describe how energy transferred by heat is converted and
transferred again by work.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Recall that the principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be altered
from one form to another.
The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a closed system equals the net heat transfer into the
system minus the net work done by the system. In equation form, the first law of thermodynamics is
12.6
Here,
is the change in internal energy, U, of the system. As shown in Figure 12.6, Q is the net heat transferred into the
system—that is, Q is the sum of all heat transfers into and out of the system. W is the net work done by the system—that is, W is
the sum of all work done on or by the system. By convention, if Q is positive, then there is a net heat transfer into the system; if
W is positive, then there is net work done by the system. So positive Q adds energy to the system by heat, and positive W takes
energy from the system by work. Note that if heat transfers more energy into the system than that which is done by work, the
difference is stored as internal energy.

Figure 12.6 The first law of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy principle stated for a system, where heat and work are the
methods of transferring energy to and from a system. Q represents the net heat transfer—it is the sum of all transfers of energy by heat into
and out of the system. Q is positive for net heat transfer into the system.

is the work done by the system, and

is the work done on

the system. W is the total work done on or by the system. W is positive when more work is done by the system than on it. The change in the
internal energy of the system,

, is related to heat and work by the first law of thermodynamics:

It follows also that negative Q indicates that energy is transferred away from the system by heat and so decreases the system’s
internal energy, whereas negative W is work done on the system, which increases the internal energy.

Biology: Biological Thermodynamics

We often think about thermodynamics as being useful for inventing or testing machinery, such as engines or steam turbines.
However, thermodynamics also applies to living systems, such as our own bodies. This forms the basis of the biological
thermodynamics (Figure 12.7).

Figure 12.7 (a) The first law of thermodynamics applies to metabolism. Heat transferred out of the body (Q) and work done by the body (W)
remove internal energy, whereas food intake replaces it. (Food intake may be considered work done on the body.) (b) Plants convert part of

the radiant energy in sunlight into stored chemical energy, a process called photosynthesis.

Life itself depends on the biological transfer of energy. Through photosynthesis, plants absorb solar energy from the sun and use
this energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis takes in one form of
energy—light—and converts it into another form—chemical potential energy (glucose and other carbohydrates).

Human metabolism is the conversion of food into energy given off by heat, work done by the body’s cells, and stored fat.
Metabolism is an interesting example of the first law of thermodynamics in action. Eating increases the internal energy of the
body by adding chemical potential energy; this is an unromantic view of a good burrito.
The body metabolizes all the food we consume. Basically, metabolism is an oxidation process in which the chemical potential
energy of food is released. This implies that food input is in the form of work. Exercise helps you lose weight, because it provides
energy transfer from your body by both heat and work and raises your metabolic rate even when you are at rest.
Biological thermodynamics also involves the study of transductions between cells and living organisms. Transduction is a
process where genetic material—DNA—is transferred from one cell to another. This often occurs during a viral infection (e.g.,
influenza) and is how the virus spreads, namely, by transferring its genetic material to an increasing number of previously
healthy cells. Once enough cells become infected, you begin to feel the effects of the virus (flu symptoms—muscle weakness,
coughing, and congestion).
Energy is transferred along with the genetic material and so obeys the first law of thermodynamics. Energy is transferred—not
created or destroyed—in the process. When work is done on a cell or heat transfers energy to a cell, the cell’s internal energy
increases. When a cell does work or loses heat, its internal energy decreases. If the amount of work done by a cell is the same as
the amount of energy transferred in by heat, or the amount of work performed on a cell matches the amount of energy
transferred out by heat, there will be no net change in internal energy.

Discussion

Figure 12.8 Two different processes produce the same change in a system. (a) A total of 15.00 J of heat transfer occurs into the system,
while work takes out a total of 6.00 J. The change in internal energy is ΔU = Q – W = 9.00 J. (b) Heat transfer removes 150.00 J from the
system while work puts 159.00 J into it, producing an increase of 9.00 J in internal energy. If the system starts out in the same state in (a)
and (b), it will end up in the same final state in either case—its final state is related to internal energy, not how that energy was acquired.

A very different process in this second worked example produces the same 9.00 J change in internal energy as in the first worked

second law of thermodynamics

Entropy
Recall from the chapter introduction that it is not even theoretically possible for engines to be 100 percent efficient. This
phenomenon is explained by the second law of thermodynamics, which relies on a concept known as entropy. Entropy is a
measure of the disorder of a system. Entropy also describes how much energy is not available to do work. The more disordered a
system and higher the entropy, the less of a system's energy is available to do work.

12.3 • Second Law of Thermodynamics: Entropy

Although all forms of energy can be used to do work, it is not possible to use the entire available energy for work. Consequently,
not all energy transferred by heat can be converted into work, and some of it is lost in the form of waste heat—that is, heat that
does not go toward doing work. The unavailability of energy is important in thermodynamics; in fact, the field originated from
efforts to convert heat to work, as is done by engines.
The equation for the change in entropy,

, is

where Q is the heat that transfers energy during a process, and T is the absolute temperature at which the process takes place.

Q is positive for energy transferred into the system by heat and negative for energy transferred out of the system by heat. In SI,
entropy is expressed in units of joules per kelvin (J/K). If temperature changes during the process, then it is usually a good
approximation (for small changes in temperature) to take T to be the average temperature in order to avoid trickier math
(calculus).

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Absolute temperature is the temperature measured in Kelvins. The Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale that is
measured in terms of the number of degrees above absolute zero. All temperatures are therefore positive. Using
temperatures from another, nonabsolute scale, such as Fahrenheit or Celsius, will give the wrong answer.

Second Law of Thermodynamics
Have you ever played the card game 52 pickup? If so, you have been on the receiving end of a practical joke and, in the process,
learned a valuable lesson about the nature of the universe as described by the second law of thermodynamics. In the game of 52
pickup, the prankster tosses an entire deck of playing cards onto the floor, and you get to pick them up. In the process of picking
up the cards, you may have noticed that the amount of work required to restore the cards to an orderly state in the deck is much
greater than the amount of work required to toss the cards and create the disorder.
The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in any
spontaneous process; it never decreases. An important implication of this law is that heat transfers energy spontaneously from
higher- to lower-temperature objects, but never spontaneously in the reverse direction. This is because entropy increases for
heat transfer of energy from hot to cold (Figure 12.9). Because the change in entropy is Q/T, there is a larger change in
at
lower temperatures (smaller T). The decrease in entropy of the hot (larger T) object is therefore less than the increase in entropy
of the cold (smaller T) object, producing an overall increase in entropy for the system.

Figure 12.9 The ice in this drink is slowly melting. Eventually, the components of the liquid will reach thermal equilibrium, as predicted by
the second law of thermodynamics—that is, after heat transfers energy from the warmer liquid to the colder ice. (Jon Sullivan, PDPhoto.org)

Another way of thinking about this is that it is impossible for any process to have, as its sole result, heat transferring energy
from a cooler to a hotter object. Heat cannot transfer energy spontaneously from colder to hotter, because the entropy of the

367

368

Chapter 12 • Thermodynamics

overall system would decrease.
Suppose we mix equal masses of water that are originally at two different temperatures, say
and
. The result
will be water at an intermediate temperature of
. Three outcomes have resulted: entropy has increased, some energy
has become unavailable to do work, and the system has become less orderly. Let us think about each of these results.
First, why has entropy increased? Mixing the two bodies of water has the same effect as the heat transfer of energy from the
higher-temperature substance to the lower-temperature substance. The mixing decreases the entropy of the hotter water but
increases the entropy of the colder water by a greater amount, producing an overall increase in entropy.
Second, once the two masses of water are mixed, there is no more temperature difference left to drive energy transfer by heat
and therefore to do work. The energy is still in the water, but it is now unavailable to do work.
Third, the mixture is less orderly, or to use another term, less structured. Rather than having two masses at different
temperatures and with different distributions of molecular speeds, we now have a single mass with a broad distribution of
molecular speeds, the average of which yields an intermediate temperature.
These three results—entropy, unavailability of energy, and disorder—not only are related but are, in fact, essentially equivalent.
Heat transfer of energy from hot to cold is related to the tendency in nature for systems to become disordered and for less
energy to be available for use as work.
Based on this law, what cannot happen? A cold object in contact with a hot one never spontaneously transfers energy by heat to
the hot object, getting colder while the hot object gets hotter. Nor does a hot, stationary automobile ever spontaneously cool off
and start moving.
Another example is the expansion of a puff of gas introduced into one corner of a vacuum chamber. The gas expands to fill the
chamber, but it never regroups on its own in the corner. The random motion of the gas molecules could take them all back to the
corner, but this is never observed to happen (Figure 12.10).

(b) The brakes of this car convert its kinetic energy to increase their internal energy (temperature), and heat transfers this energy to the
environment. The reverse process is impossible. (c) The burst of gas released into this vacuum chamber quickly expands to uniformly fill
every part of the chamber. The random motions of the gas molecules will prevent them from returning altogether to the corner.

We've explained that heat never transfers energy spontaneously from a colder to a hotter object. The key word here is
spontaneously. If we do work on a system, it is possible to transfer energy by heat from a colder to hotter object. We'll learn
more about this in the next section, covering refrigerators as one of the applications of the laws of thermodynamics.
Sometimes people misunderstand the second law of thermodynamics, thinking that based on this law, it is impossible for
entropy to decrease at any particular location. But, it actually is possible for the entropy of one part of the universe to decrease,
as long as the total change in entropy of the universe increases. In equation form, we can write this as

Based on this equation, we see that

can be negative as long as

is positive and greater in magnitude.

How is it possible for the entropy of a system to decrease? Energy transfer is necessary. If you pick up marbles that are scattered
about the room and put them into a cup, your work has decreased the entropy of that system. If you gather iron ore from the
ground and convert it into steel and build a bridge, your work has decreased the entropy of that system. Energy coming from the
sun can decrease the entropy of local systems on Earth—that is,
is negative. But the overall entropy of the rest of the
is positive and greater in magnitude. In the case of the iron ore,
universe increases by a greater amount—that is,
although you made the system of the bridge and steel more structured, you did so at the expense of the universe. Altogether, the
entropy of the universe is increased by the disorder created by digging up the ore and converting it to steel. Therefore,
12.14

369

370

Chapter 12 • Thermodynamics

and the second law of thermodynamics is not violated.
Every time a plant stores some solar energy in the form of chemical potential energy, or an updraft of warm air lifts a soaring
bird, Earth experiences local decreases in entropy as it uses part of the energy transfer from the sun into deep space to do work.
There is a large total increase in entropy resulting from this massive energy transfer. A small part of this energy transfer by heat
is stored in structured systems on Earth, resulting in much smaller, local decreases in entropy.

Solving Problems Involving the Second Law of Thermodynamics
Entropy is related not only to the unavailability of energy to do work; it is also a measure of disorder. For example, in the case of
a melting block of ice, a highly structured and orderly system of water molecules changes into a disorderly liquid, in which
molecules have no fixed positions (Figure 12.11). There is a large increase in entropy for this process, as we'll see in the following
worked example.

Figure 12.11 These ice floes melt during the Arctic summer. Some of them refreeze in the winter, but the second law of thermodynamics
predicts that it would be extremely unlikely for the water molecules contained in these particular floes to reform in the distinctive alligatorlike shape they possessed when this picture was taken in the summer of 2009. (Patrick Kelley, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Geological Survey)

Discussion

Figure 12.12 When ice melts, it becomes more disordered and less structured. The systematic arrangement of molecules in a crystal
structure is replaced by a more random and less orderly movement of molecules without fixed locations or orientations. Its entropy
increases because heat transfer occurs into it. Entropy is a measure of disorder.

The change in entropy is positive, because heat transfers energy into the ice to cause the phase change. This is a significant
increase in entropy, because it takes place at a relatively low temperature. It is accompanied by an increase in the disorder of the
water molecules.

Heat Engines, Heat Pumps, and Refrigerators
In this section, we’ll explore how heat engines, heat pumps, and refrigerators operate in terms of the laws of thermodynamics.
One of the most important things we can do with heat is to use it to do work for us. A heat engine does exactly this—it makes
use of the properties of thermodynamics to transform heat into work. Gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines, and steam
turbines that generate electricity are all examples of heat engines.
Figure 12.13 illustrates one of the ways in which heat transfers energy to do work. Fuel combustion releases chemical energy that
heat transfers throughout the gas in a cylinder. This increases the gas temperature, which in turn increases the pressure of the
gas and, therefore, the force it exerts on a movable piston. The gas does work on the outside world, as this force moves the piston
through some distance. Thus, heat transfer of energy to the gas in the cylinder results in work being done.

Access for free at openstax.org.

12.4 • Applications of Thermodynamics: Heat Engines, Heat Pumps, and Refrigerators

Figure 12.13 (a) Heat transfer to the gas in a cylinder increases the internal energy of the gas, creating higher pressure and temperature.
(b) The force exerted on the movable cylinder does work as the gas expands. Gas pressure and temperature decrease during expansion,
indicating that the gas’s internal energy has decreased as it does work. (c) Heat transfer of energy to the environment further reduces
pressure in the gas, so that the piston can more easily return to its starting position.

To repeat this process, the piston needs to be returned to its starting point. Heat now transfers energy from the gas to the
surroundings, so that the gas’s pressure decreases, and a force is exerted by the surroundings to push the piston back through
some distance.
A cyclical process brings a system, such as the gas in a cylinder, back to its original state at the end of every cycle. All heat
engines use cyclical processes.
Heat engines do work by using part of the energy transferred by heat from some source. As shown in Figure 12.14, heat transfers
energy,
, from the high-temperature object (or hot reservoir), whereas heat transfers unused energy,
, into the lowtemperature object (or cold reservoir), and the work done by the engine is W. In physics, a reservoir is defined as an infinitely
large mass that can take in or put out an unlimited amount of heat, depending upon the needs of the system. The temperature
of the hot reservoir is
and the temperature of the cold reservoir is
.

373

374

Chapter 12 • Thermodynamics

Figure 12.14 (a) Heat transfers energy spontaneously from a hot object to a cold one, as is consistent with the second law of
thermodynamics. (b) A heat engine, represented here by a circle, uses part of the energy transferred by heat to do work. The hot and cold
objects are called the hot and cold reservoirs. Qh is the heat out of the hot reservoir, W is the work output, and Qc is the unused heat into
the cold reservoir.

As noted, a cyclical process brings the system back to its original condition at the end of every cycle. Such a system’s internal
energy, U, is the same at the beginning and end of every cycle—that is,
. The first law of thermodynamics states that
where Q is the net heat transfer during the cycle, and W is the net work done by the system. The net heat
transfer is the energy transferred in by heat from the hot reservoir minus the amount that is transferred out to the cold reservoir
(
). Because there is no change in internal energy for a complete cycle (
), we have
12.19
so that
12.20
Therefore, the net work done by the system equals the net heat into the system, or
12.21
for a cyclical process.
Because the hot reservoir is heated externally, which is an energy-intensive process, it is important that the work be done as
efficiently as possible. In fact, we want W to equal
, and for there to be no heat to the environment (that is,
).
Unfortunately, this is impossible. According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat engines cannot have perfect conversion
of heat into work. Recall that entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system, which is also how much energy is unavailable to
do work. The second law of thermodynamics requires that the total entropy of a system either increases or remains constant in
any process. Therefore, there is a minimum amount of
that cannot be used for work. The amount of heat rejected to the cold
reservoir,
depends upon the efficiency of the heat engine. The smaller the increase in entropy,
, the smaller the value of
, and the more heat energy is available to do work.
Heat pumps, air conditioners, and refrigerators utilize heat transfer of energy from low to high temperatures, which is the
opposite of what heat engines do. Heat transfers energy
from a cold reservoir and delivers energy
into a hot one. This
requires work input, W, which produces a transfer of energy by heat. Therefore, the total heat transfer to the hot reservoir is
12.22
The purpose of a heat pump is to transfer energy by heat to a warm environment, such as a home in the winter. The great
advantage of using a heat pump to keep your home warm rather than just burning fuel in a fireplace or furnace is that a heat
pump supplies
. Heat
comes from the outside air, even at a temperature below freezing, to the indoor space.
You only pay for W, and you get an additional heat transfer of
from the outside at no cost. In many cases, at least twice as
much energy is transferred to the heated space as is used to run the heat pump. When you burn fuel to keep warm, you pay for
all of it. The disadvantage to a heat pump is that the work input (required by the second law of thermodynamics) is sometimes

12.4 • Applications of Thermodynamics: Heat Engines, Heat Pumps, and Refrigerators

more expensive than simply burning fuel, especially if the work is provided by electrical energy.
The basic components of a heat pump are shown in Figure 12.15. A working fluid, such as a refrigerant, is used. In the outdoor
coils (the evaporator), heat
enters the working fluid from the cold outdoor air, turning it into a gas.

Figure 12.15 A simple heat pump has four basic components: (1) an evaporator, (2) a compressor, (3) a condenser, and (4) an expansion
valve. In the heating mode, heat transfers

to the working fluid in the evaporator (1) from the colder, outdoor air, turning it into a gas. The

electrically driven compressor (2) increases the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils (3) inside the
heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature in the room, heat transfers energy from the gas to the
room as the gas condenses into a liquid. The working fluid is then cooled as it flows back through an expansion valve (4) to the outdoor
evaporator coils.

The electrically driven compressor (work input W) raises the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the
condenser coils that are inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature inside the
room, heat transfers energy to the room, and the gas condenses into a liquid. The liquid then flows back through an expansion
(pressure-reducing) valve. The liquid, having been cooled through expansion, returns to the outdoor evaporator coils to resume
the cycle.
The quality of a heat pump is judged by how much energy is transferred by heat into the warm space (
much input work (W) is required.

surrounding room. For an air conditioner, heat is transferred outdoors from inside a home. Heat pumps are also often used in a
reverse setting to cool rooms in the summer.
As with heat pumps, work input is required for heat transfer of energy from cold to hot. The quality of air conditioners and
refrigerators is judged by how much energy is removed by heat
from a cold environment, compared with how much work,
W, is required. So, what is considered the energy benefit in a heat pump, is considered waste heat in a refrigerator.

Thermal Efficiency
In the conversion of energy into work, we are always faced with the problem of getting less out than we put in. The problem is
that transfers energy to the environment—and usually a very significant amount at
that, in all processes, there is some heat
that. A way to quantify how efficiently a machine runs is through a quantity called thermal efficiency.
We define thermal efficiency, Eff, to be the ratio of useful energy output to the energy input (or, in other words, the ratio of what
we get to what we spend). The efficiency of a heat engine is the output of net work, W, divided by heat-transferred energy,
,
into the engine; that is

An efficiency of 1, or 100 percent, would be possible only if there were no heat to the environment (

).

Discussion
The efficiency found is close to the usual value of 42 percent for coal-burning power stations. It means that fully 59.2 percent of
the energy is transferred by heat to the environment, which usually results in warming lakes, rivers, or the ocean near the power
station and is implicated in a warming planet generally. While the laws of thermodynamics limit the efficiency of such
plants—including plants fired by nuclear fuel, oil, and natural gas—the energy transferred by heat to the environment could be,
and sometimes is, used for heating homes or for industrial processes.

SECTION SUMMARY
12.1 Zeroth Law of
Thermodynamics: Thermal
Equilibrium
• Systems are in thermal equilibrium when they have the
same temperature.
• Thermal equilibrium occurs when two bodies are in
contact with each other and can freely exchange energy.
• The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that when two
systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each
other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third
system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C.

12.2 First law of Thermodynamics:
Thermal Energy and Work
• Pressure is the force per unit area over which the force
is applied perpendicular to the area.
• Thermal expansion is the increase, or decrease, of the
size (length, area, or volume) of a body due to a change
in temperature.
• The ideal gas law relates the pressure and volume of a
gas to the number of gas particles (atoms or molecules)
and the absolute temperature of the gas.
• Heat and work are the two distinct methods of energy
transfer.
• Heat is energy transferred solely due to a temperature
difference.
• The first law of thermodynamics is given as
, where
is the change in internal
energy of a system, Q is the net energy transfer into the
system by heat (the sum of all transfers by heat into and
out of the system), and W is the net work done by the

Access for free at openstax.org.

system (the sum of all energy transfers by work out of or
into the system).
• Both Q and W represent energy in transit; only
represents an independent quantity of energy capable
of being stored.
• The internal energy U of a system depends only on the
state of the system, and not how it reached that state.

12.3 Second Law of
Thermodynamics: Entropy
• Entropy is a measure of a system's disorder: the greater
the disorder, the larger the entropy.
• Entropy is also the reduced availability of energy to do
work.
• The second law of thermodynamics states that, for any
spontaneous process, the total entropy of a system
either increases or remains constant; it never decreases.
• Heat transfers energy spontaneously from higher- to
lower-temperature bodies, but never spontaneously in
the reverse direction.

12.4 Applications of
Thermodynamics: Heat Engines,
Heat Pumps, and Refrigerators
• Heat engines use the heat transfer of energy to do work.
• Cyclical processes are processes that return to their
original state at the end of every cycle.
• The thermal efficiency of a heat engine is the ratio of
work output divided by the amount of energy input.
• The amount of work a heat engine can do is determined
by the net heat transfer of energy during a cycle; more
waste heat leads to less work output.

Chapter 12 • Key Equations

• Heat pumps draw energy by heat from cold outside air
and use it to heat an interior room.
• A refrigerator is a type of heat pump; it takes energy

INTRODUCTION Recall from the chapter on Motion in Two Dimensions that oscillations—the back-and-forth movement
between two points—involve force and energy. Some oscillations create waves, such as the sound waves created by plucking a
guitar string. Other examples of waves include earthquakes and visible light. Even subatomic particles, such as electrons, can
behave like waves. You can make water waves in a swimming pool by slapping the water with your hand. Some of these waves,
such as water waves, are visible; others, such as sound waves, are not. But every wave is a disturbance that moves from its source
and carries energy. In this chapter, we will learn about the different types of waves, their properties, and how they interact with
one another.

Mechanical Waves
What do we mean when we say something is a wave? A wave is a disturbance that travels or propagates from the place where it
was created. Waves transfer energy from one place to another, but they do not necessarily transfer any mass. Light, sound, and
waves in the ocean are common examples of waves. Sound and water waves are mechanical waves; meaning, they require a
medium to travel through. The medium may be a solid, a liquid, or a gas, and the speed of the wave depends on the material
properties of the medium through which it is traveling. However, light is not a mechanical wave; it can travel through a vacuum
such as the empty parts of outer space.
A familiar wave that you can easily imagine is the water wave. For water waves, the disturbance is in the surface of the water, an
example of which is the disturbance created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the water surface
repeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is caused by a change in air pressure, an example of which is when the oscillating
cone inside a speaker creates a disturbance. For earthquakes, there are several types of disturbances, which include the
disturbance of Earth’s surface itself and the pressure disturbances under the surface. Even radio waves are most easily
understood using an analogy with water waves. Because water waves are common and visible, visualizing water waves may help
you in studying other types of waves, especially those that are not visible.
Water waves have characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude, period, frequency, and energy, which we will discuss
in the next section.

Pulse Waves and Periodic Waves
If you drop a pebble into the water, only a few waves may be generated before the disturbance dies down, whereas in a wave
pool, the waves are continuous. A pulse wave is a sudden disturbance in which only one wave or a few waves are generated, such
as in the example of the pebble. Thunder and explosions also create pulse waves. A periodic wave repeats the same oscillation for
several cycles, such as in the case of the wave pool, and is associated with simple harmonic motion. Each particle in the medium
experiences simple harmonic motion in periodic waves by moving back and forth periodically through the same positions.
Consider the simplified water wave in Figure 13.2. This wave is an up-and-down disturbance of the water surface, characterized
by a sine wave pattern. The uppermost position is called the crest and the lowest is the trough. It causes a seagull to move up and
down in simple harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs pass under the bird.

Figure 13.2 An idealized ocean wave passes under a seagull that bobs up and down in simple harmonic motion.

13.1 • Types of Waves

Longitudinal Waves and Transverse Waves
Mechanical waves are categorized by their type of motion and fall into any of two categories: transverse or longitudinal. Note
that both transverse and longitudinal waves can be periodic. A transverse wave propagates so that the disturbance is
perpendicular to the direction of propagation. An example of a transverse wave is shown in Figure 13.3, where a woman moves a
toy spring up and down, generating waves that propagate away from herself in the horizontal direction while disturbing the toy
spring in the vertical direction.

Figure 13.3 In this example of a transverse wave, the wave propagates horizontally and the disturbance in the toy spring is in the vertical
direction.

In contrast, in a longitudinal wave, the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation. Figure 13.4 shows an example of a
longitudinal wave, where the woman now creates a disturbance in the horizontal direction—which is the same direction as the
wave propagation—by stretching and then compressing the toy spring.

Figure 13.4 In this example of a longitudinal wave, the wave propagates horizontally and the disturbance in the toy spring is also in the
horizontal direction.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

Longitudinal waves are sometimes called compression waves or compressional waves, and transverse waves are sometimes
called shear waves.
Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of the two. The waves on the strings of musical instruments are
transverse (as shown in Figure 13.5), and so are electromagnetic waves, such as visible light. Sound waves in air and water are
longitudinal. Their disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids.

391

392

Chapter 13 • Waves and Their Properties

Figure 13.5 The wave on a guitar string is transverse. However, the sound wave coming out of a speaker rattles a sheet of paper in a
direction that shows that such sound wave is longitudinal.

Sound in solids can be both longitudinal and transverse. Essentially, water waves are also a combination of transverse and
longitudinal components, although the simplified water wave illustrated in Figure 13.2 does not show the longitudinal motion of
the bird.
Earthquake waves under Earth’s surface have both longitudinal and transverse components as well. The longitudinal waves in an
earthquake are called pressure or P-waves, and the transverse waves are called shear or S-waves. These components have
important individual characteristics; for example, they propagate at different speeds. Earthquakes also have surface waves that
are similar to surface waves on water.

FUN IN PHYSICS
The Physics of Surfing

Many people enjoy surfing in the ocean. For some surfers, the bigger the wave, the better. In one area off the coast of central
California, waves can reach heights of up to 50 feet in certain times of the year (Figure 13.6).

Figure 13.6 A surfer negotiates a steep take-off on a winter day in California while his friend watches. (Ljsurf, Wikimedia Commons)

How do waves reach such extreme heights? Other than unusual causes, such as when earthquakes produce tsunami waves, most
huge waves are caused simply by interactions between the wind and the surface of the water. The wind pushes up against the
surface of the water and transfers energy to the water in the process. The stronger the wind, the more energy transferred. As
waves start to form, a larger surface area becomes in contact with the wind, and even more energy is transferred from the wind
to the water, thus creating higher waves. Intense storms create the fastest winds, kicking up massive waves that travel out from
the origin of the storm. Longer-lasting storms and those storms that affect a larger area of the ocean create the biggest waves
since they transfer more energy. The cycle of the tides from the Moon’s gravitational pull also plays a small role in creating waves.
Actual ocean waves are more complicated than the idealized model of the simple transverse wave with a perfect sinusoidal
shape. Ocean waves are examples of orbital progressive waves, where water particles at the surface follow a circular path from
the crest to the trough of the passing wave, then cycle back again to their original position. This cycle repeats with each passing
wave.
As waves reach shore, the water depth decreases and the energy of the wave is compressed into a smaller volume. This creates
higher waves—an effect known as shoaling.
Since the water particles along the surface move from the crest to the trough, surfers hitch a ride on the cascading water, gliding
along the surface. If ocean waves work exactly like the idealized transverse waves, surfing would be much less exciting as it
would simply involve standing on a board that bobs up and down in place, just like the seagull in the previous figure.
Additional information and illustrations about the scientific principles behind surfing can be found in the “Using Science to Surf
Better!” (http://www.openstax.org/l/28Surf) video.

Wave Variables
In the chapter on motion in two dimensions, we defined the following variables to describe harmonic motion:
• Amplitude—maximum displacement from the equilibrium position of an object oscillating around such equilibrium
position
• Frequency—number of events per unit of time
• Period—time it takes to complete one oscillation
For waves, these variables have the same basic meaning. However, it is helpful to word the definitions in a more specific way that
applies directly to waves:
• Amplitude—distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement of the wave
• Frequency—number of waves passing by a specific point per second
• Period—time it takes for one wave cycle to complete
In addition to amplitude, frequency, and period, their wavelength and wave velocity also characterize waves. The wavelength
is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave, parallel to the direction of propagation. The wave velocity
is the
speed at which the disturbance moves.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

Wave velocity is sometimes also called the propagation velocity or propagation speed because the disturbance propagates
from one location to another.
Consider the periodic water wave in Figure 13.7. Its wavelength is the distance from crest to crest or from trough to trough. The
wavelength can also be thought of as the distance a wave has traveled after one complete cycle—or one period. The time for one
complete up-and-down motion is the simple water wave’s period T. In the figure, the wave itself moves to the right with a wave

velocity vw. Its amplitude X is the distance between the resting position and the maximum displacement—either the crest or the
trough—of the wave. It is important to note that this movement of the wave is actually the disturbance moving to the right, not
the water itself; otherwise, the bird would move to the right. Instead, the seagull bobs up and down in place as waves pass
underneath, traveling a total distance of 2X in one cycle. However, as mentioned in the text feature on surfing, actual ocean
waves are more complex than this simplified example.

Figure 13.7 The wave has a wavelength λ, which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. The up-and-down
disturbance of the surface propagates parallel to the surface at a speed vw.

The Relationship between Wave Frequency, Period, Wavelength, and
Velocity
Since wave frequency is the number of waves per second, and the period is essentially the number of seconds per wave, the
relationship between frequency and period is
13.1
or
13.2
just as in the case of harmonic motion of an object. We can see from this relationship that a higher frequency means a shorter
period. Recall that the unit for frequency is hertz (Hz), and that 1 Hz is one cycle—or one wave—per second.
The speed of propagation vw is the distance the wave travels in a given time, which is one wavelength in a time of one period. In

equation form, it is written as
13.3
or
13.4
From this relationship, we see that in a medium where vw is constant, the higher the frequency, the smaller the wavelength. See
Figure 13.8.

Figure 13.8 Because they travel at the same speed in a given medium, low-frequency sounds must have a greater wavelength than highfrequency sounds. Here, the lower-frequency sounds are emitted by the large speaker, called a woofer, while the higher-frequency sounds
are emitted by the small speaker, called a tweeter.

These fundamental relationships hold true for all types of waves. As an example, for water waves, vw is the speed of a surface
wave; for sound, vw is the speed of sound; and for visible light, vw is the speed of light. The amplitude X is completely
independent of the speed of propagation vw and depends only on the amount of energy in the wave.

Snap Lab
Waves in a Bowl

In this lab, you will take measurements to determine how the amplitude and the period of waves are affected by the transfer
of energy from a cork dropped into the water. The cork initially has some potential energy when it is held above the
water—the greater the height, the higher the potential energy. When it is dropped, such potential energy is converted to
kinetic energy as the cork falls. When the cork hits the water, that energy travels through the water in waves.

LINKS TO PHYSICS
Geology: Physics of Seismic Waves

Figure 13.9 The destructive effect of an earthquake is a palpable evidence of the energy carried in the earthquake waves. The Richter scale
rating of earthquakes is related to both their amplitude and the energy they carry. (Petty Officer 2nd Class Candice Villarreal, U.S. Navy)

Geologists rely heavily on physics to study earthquakes since earthquakes involve several types of wave disturbances, including
disturbance of Earth’s surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Surface earthquake waves are similar to surface
waves on water. The waves under Earth’s surface have both longitudinal and transverse components. The longitudinal waves in
an earthquake are called pressure waves (P-waves) and the transverse waves are called shear waves (S-waves). These two types of
waves propagate at different speeds, and the speed at which they travel depends on the rigidity of the medium through which
they are traveling. During earthquakes, the speed of P-waves in granite is significantly higher than the speed of S-waves. Both
components of earthquakes travel more slowly in less rigid materials, such as sediments. P-waves have speeds of 4 to 7 km/s,
and S-waves have speeds of 2 to 5 km/s, but both are faster in more rigid materials. The P-wave gets progressively farther ahead
of the S-wave as they travel through Earth’s crust. For that reason, the time difference between the P- and S-waves is used to
determine the distance to their source, the epicenter of the earthquake.
We know from seismic waves produced by earthquakes that parts of the interior of Earth are liquid. Shear or transverse waves
cannot travel through a liquid and are not transmitted through Earth’s core. In contrast, compression or longitudinal waves can
pass through a liquid and they do go through the core.
All waves carry energy, and the energy of earthquake waves is easy to observe based on the amount of damage left behind after
the ground has stopped moving. Earthquakes can shake whole cities to the ground, performing the work of thousands of
wrecking balls. The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude. Large-amplitude earthquakes produce large ground
displacements and greater damage. As earthquake waves spread out, their amplitude decreases, so there is less damage the
farther they get from the source.

Superposition of Waves
Most waves do not look very simple. They look more like the waves in Figure 13.10, rather than the simple water wave considered
in the previous sections, which has a perfect sinusoidal shape.

Figure 13.10 These waves result from the superposition of several waves from different sources, producing a complex pattern.
(Waterborough, Wikimedia Commons)

Most waves appear complex because they result from two or more simple waves that combine as they come together at the same
place at the same time—a phenomenon called superposition.
Waves superimpose by adding their disturbances; each disturbance corresponds to a force, and all the forces add. If the
disturbances are along the same line, then the resulting wave is a simple addition of the disturbances of the individual waves,
that is, their amplitudes add.

Wave Interference
The two special cases of superposition that produce the simplest results are pure constructive interference and pure destructive
interference.
Pure constructive interference occurs when two identical waves arrive at the same point exactly in phase. When waves are
exactly in phase, the crests of the two waves are precisely aligned, as are the troughs. Refer to Figure 13.11. Because the
disturbances add, the pure constructive interference of two waves with the same amplitude produces a wave that has twice the
amplitude of the two individual waves, but has the same wavelength.

13.3 • Wave Interaction: Superposition and Interference

Figure 13.11 The pure constructive interference of two identical waves produces a wave with twice the amplitude but the same
wavelength.

Figure 13.12 shows two identical waves that arrive exactly out of phase—that is, precisely aligned crest to trough—producing
pure destructive interference. Because the disturbances are in opposite directions for this superposition, the resulting
amplitude is zero for pure destructive interference; that is, the waves completely cancel out each other.

Figure 13.12 The pure destructive interference of two identical waves produces zero amplitude, or complete cancellation.

While pure constructive interference and pure destructive interference can occur, they are not very common because they
require precisely aligned identical waves. The superposition of most waves that we see in nature produces a combination of
constructive and destructive interferences.
Waves that are not results of pure constructive or destructive interference can vary from place to place and time to time. The
sound from a stereo, for example, can be loud in one spot and soft in another. The varying loudness means that the sound waves
add partially constructively and partially destructively at different locations. A stereo has at least two speakers that create sound
waves, and waves can reflect from walls. All these waves superimpose.
An example of sounds that vary over time from constructive to destructive is found in the combined whine of jet engines heard
by a stationary passenger. The volume of the combined sound can fluctuate up and down as the sound from the two engines
varies in time from constructive to destructive.
The two previous examples considered waves that are similar—both stereo speakers generate sound waves with the same
amplitude and wavelength, as do the jet engines. But what happens when two waves that are not similar, that is, having
different amplitudes and wavelengths, are superimposed? An example of the superposition of two dissimilar waves is shown in
Figure 13.13. Here again, the disturbances add and subtract, but they produce an even more complicated-looking wave. The
resultant wave from the combined disturbances of two dissimilar waves looks much different than the idealized sinusoidal
shape of a periodic wave.

In this simulation, make waves with a dripping faucet, an audio speaker, or a laser by switching between the water, sound,
and light tabs. Contrast and compare how the different types of waves behave. Try rotating the view from top to side to
make observations. Then experiment with adding a second source or a pair of slits to create an interference pattern.

GRASP CHECK
In the water tab, compare the waves generated by one drip versus two drips. What happens to the amplitude of the
waves when there are two drips? Is this constructive or destructive interference? Why would this be the case?
a. The amplitude of the water waves remains same because of the destructive interference as the drips of water hit the
surface at the same time.
b. The amplitude of the water waves is canceled because of the destructive interference as the drips of water hit the
surface at the same time.
c. The amplitude of water waves remains same because of the constructive interference as the drips of water hit the
surface at the same time.
d. The amplitude of water waves doubles because of the constructive interference as the drips of water hit the surface
at the same time.

Standing Waves
Sometimes waves do not seem to move and they appear to just stand in place, vibrating. Such waves are called standing waves
and are formed by the superposition of two or more waves moving in opposite directions. The waves move through each other
with their disturbances adding as they go by. If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they alternate
between constructive and destructive interference. Standing waves created by the superposition of two identical waves moving
in opposite directions are illustrated in Figure 13.14.

Figure 13.14 A standing wave is created by the superposition of two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The oscillations are at
fixed locations in space and result from alternating constructive and destructive interferences.

As an example, standing waves can be seen on the surface of a glass of milk in a refrigerator. The vibrations from the refrigerator
motor create waves on the milk that oscillate up and down but do not seem to move across the surface. The two waves that

produce standing waves may be due to the reflections from the side of the glass.
Earthquakes can create standing waves and cause constructive and destructive interferences. As the earthquake waves travel
along the surface of Earth and reflect off denser rocks, constructive interference occurs at certain points. As a result, areas closer
to the epicenter are not damaged while areas farther from the epicenter are damaged.
Standing waves are also found on the strings of musical instruments and are due to reflections of waves from the ends of the
string. Figure 13.15 and Figure 13.16 show three standing waves that can be created on a string that is fixed at both ends. When
the wave reaches the fixed end, it has nowhere else to go but back where it came from, causing the reflection. The nodes are the
points where the string does not move; more generally, the nodes are the points where the wave disturbance is zero in a standing
wave. The fixed ends of strings must be nodes, too, because the string cannot move there.
The antinode is the location of maximum amplitude in standing waves. The standing waves on a string have a frequency that is
of the disturbance on the string. The wavelength is determined by the distance between
related to the propagation speed
the points where the string is fixed in place.

Figure 13.15 The figure shows a string oscillating with its maximum disturbance as the antinode.

Figure 13.16 The figure shows a string oscillating with multiple nodes.

Reflection and Refraction of Waves
As we saw in the case of standing waves on the strings of a musical instrument, reflection is the change in direction of a wave
when it bounces off a barrier, such as a fixed end. When the wave hits the fixed end, it changes direction, returning to its source.
As it is reflected, the wave experiences an inversion, which means that it flips vertically. If a wave hits the fixed end with a crest,
it will return as a trough, and vice versa (Henderson 2015). Refer to Figure 13.17.

Figure 13.17 A wave is inverted after reflection from a fixed end.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

If the end is not fixed, it is said to be a free end, and no inversion occurs. When the end is loosely attached, it reflects without

403

404

Chapter 13 • Waves and Their Properties

inversion, and when the end is not attached to anything, it does not reflect at all. You may have noticed this while changing
the settings from Fixed End to Loose End to No End in the Waves on a String PhET simulation.
Rather than encountering a fixed end or barrier, waves sometimes pass from one medium into another, for instance, from air
into water. Different types of media have different properties, such as density or depth, that affect how a wave travels through
them. At the boundary between media, waves experience refraction—they change their path of propagation. As the wave bends,
it also changes its speed and wavelength upon entering the new medium. Refer to Figure 13.18.

Figure 13.18 A wave refracts as it enters a different medium.

For example, water waves traveling from the deep end to the shallow end of a swimming pool experience refraction. They bend
in a path closer to perpendicular to the surface of the water, propagate slower, and decrease in wavelength as they enter
shallower water.

Sound

INTRODUCTION If a tree falls in a forest (see Figure 14.1) and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? The answer to
this old philosophical question depends on how you define sound. If sound only exists when someone is around to perceive it,
then the falling tree produced no sound. However, in physics, we know that colliding objects can disturb the air, water or other
matter surrounding them. As a result of the collision, the surrounding particles of matter began vibrating in a wave-like
fashion. This is a sound wave. Consequently, if a tree collided with another object in space, no one would hear it, because no
sound would be produced. This is because, in space, there is no air, water or other matter to be disturbed and produce sound
waves. In this chapter, we’ll learn more about the wave properties of sound, and explore hearing, as well as some special uses for
sound.

Properties of Sound Waves
Sound is a wave. More specifically, sound is defined to be a disturbance of matter that is transmitted from its source outward. A
disturbance is anything that is moved from its state of equilibrium. Some sound waves can be characterized as periodic waves,
which means that the atoms that make up the matter experience simple harmonic motion.
A vibrating string produces a sound wave as illustrated in Figure 14.2, Figure 14.3, and Figure 14.4. As the string oscillates back
and forth, part of the string’s energy goes into compressing and expanding the surrounding air. This creates slightly higher and
lower pressures. The higher pressure... regions are compressions, and the low pressure regions are rarefactions. The pressure
disturbance moves through the air as longitudinal waves with the same frequency as the string. Some of the energy is lost in the
form of thermal energy transferred to the air. You may recall from the chapter on waves that areas of compression and
rarefaction in longitudinal waves (such as sound) are analogous to crests and troughs in transverse waves.

Figure 14.2 A vibrating string moving to the right compresses the air in front of it and expands the air behind it.

Figure 14.3 As the string moves to the left, it creates another compression and rarefaction as the particles on the right move away from the
string.

14.1 • Speed of Sound, Frequency, and Wavelength

Figure 14.4 After many vibrations, there is a series of compressions and rarefactions that have been transmitted from the string as a sound
wave. The graph shows gauge pressure (Pgauge) versus distance x from the source. Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric
pressure; it is positive for pressures above atmospheric pressure, and negative for pressures below it. For ordinary, everyday sounds,
pressures vary only slightly from average atmospheric pressure.

The amplitude of a sound wave decreases with distance from its source, because the energy of the wave is spread over a larger
and larger area. But some of the energy is also absorbed by objects, such as the eardrum in Figure 14.5, and some of the energy is
converted to thermal energy in the air. Figure 14.4 shows a graph of gauge pressure versus distance from the vibrating string.
From this figure, you can see that the compression of a longitudinal wave is analogous to the peak of a transverse wave, and the
rarefaction of a longitudinal wave is analogous to the trough of a transverse wave. Just as a transverse wave alternates between
peaks and troughs, a longitudinal wave alternates between compression and rarefaction.

Figure 14.5 Sound wave compressions and rarefactions travel up the ear canal and force the eardrum to vibrate. There is a net force on the
eardrum, since the sound wave pressures differ from the atmospheric pressure found behind the eardrum. A complicated mechanism
converts the vibrations to nerve impulses, which are then interpreted by the brain.

The Speed of Sound
The speed of sound varies greatly depending upon the medium it is traveling through. The speed of sound in a medium is
determined by a combination of the medium’s rigidity (or compressibility in gases) and its density. The more rigid (or less
compressible) the medium, the faster the speed of sound. The greater the density of a medium, the slower the speed of sound.
The speed of sound in air is low, because air is compressible. Because liquids and solids are relatively rigid and very difficult to
compress, the speed of sound in such media is generally greater than in gases. Table 14.1 shows the speed of sound in various
media. Since temperature affects density, the speed of sound varies with the temperature of the medium through which it’s
traveling to some extent, especially for gases.

The Relationship Between the Speed of Sound and the Frequency and
Wavelength of a Sound Wave

Figure 14.6 When fireworks explode in the sky, the light energy is perceived before the sound energy. Sound travels more slowly than light
does. (Dominic Alves, Flickr)

Sound, like all waves, travels at certain speeds through different media and has the properties of frequency and wavelength.
Sound travels much slower than light—you can observe this while watching a fireworks display (see Figure 14.6), since the flash
of an explosion is seen before its sound is heard.
The relationship between the speed of sound, its frequency, and wavelength is the same as for all waves:
14.1
where v is the speed of sound (in units of m/s), f is its frequency (in units of hertz), and is its wavelength (in units of meters).
Recall that wavelength is defined as the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave. The wavelength of a sound,
therefore, is the distance between adjacent identical parts of a sound wave. Just as the distance between adjacent crests in a
transverse wave is one wavelength, the distance between adjacent compressions in a sound wave is also one wavelength, as
shown in Figure 14.7. The frequency of a sound wave is the same as that of the source. For example, a tuning fork vibrating at a
given frequency would produce sound waves that oscillate at that same frequency. The frequency of a sound is the number of
waves that pass a point per unit time.

Figure 14.7 A sound wave emanates from a source vibrating at a frequency f, propagates at v, and has a wavelength

.

One of the more important properties of sound is that its speed is nearly independent of frequency. If this were not the case,
and high-frequency sounds traveled faster, for example, then the farther you were from a band in a football stadium, the more
the sound from the low-pitch instruments would lag behind the high-pitch ones. But the music from all instruments arrives in
cadence independent of distance, and so all frequencies must travel at nearly the same speed.
Recall that
, and in a given medium under fixed temperature and humidity, v is constant. Therefore, the relationship
between f and is inverse: The higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength of a sound wave.
The speed of sound can change when sound travels from one medium to another. However, the frequency usually remains the
same because it is like a driven oscillation and maintains the frequency of the original source. If v changes and f remains the
same, then the wavelength must change. Since
, the higher the speed of a sound, the greater its wavelength for a given
frequency.

This simulation lets you see sound waves. Adjust the frequency or amplitude (volume) and you can see and hear how the
wave changes. Move the listener around and hear what she hears. Switch to the Two Source Interference tab or the
Interference by Reflection tab to experiment with interference and reflection.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Make sure to have audio enabled and set to Listener rather than Speaker, or else the sound will not vary as you move the
listener around.

GRASP CHECK
In the first tab, Listen to a Single Source, move the listener as far away from the speaker as possible, and then change the
frequency of the sound wave. You may have noticed that there is a delay between the time when you change the setting
and the time when you hear the sound get lower or higher in pitch. Why is this?
a. Because, intensity of the sound wave changes with the frequency.
b. Because, the speed of the sound wave changes when the frequency is changed.
c. Because, loudness of the sound wave takes time to adjust after a change in frequency.
d. Because it takes time for sound to reach the listener, so the listener perceives the new frequency of sound wave after
a delay.
Is there a difference in the amount of delay depending on whether you make the frequency higher or lower? Why?
a. Yes, the speed of propagation depends only on the frequency of the wave.
b. Yes, the speed of propagation depends upon the wavelength of the wave, and wavelength changes as the frequency
changes.
c. No, the speed of propagation depends only on the wavelength of the wave.
d. No, the speed of propagation is constant in a given medium; only the wavelength changes as the frequency changes.

LINKS TO PHYSICS
Echolocation

Figure 14.8 A bat uses sound echoes to find its way about and to catch prey. The time for the echo to return is directly proportional to the
distance.

Echolocation is the use of reflected sound waves to locate and identify objects. It is used by animals such as bats, dolphins and
whales, and is also imitated by humans in SONAR—Sound Navigation and Ranging—and echolocation technology.
Bats, dolphins and whales use echolocation to navigate and find food in their environment. They locate an object (or obstacle) by
emitting a sound and then sensing the reflected sound waves. Since the speed of sound in air is constant, the time it takes for
the sound to travel to the object and back gives the animal a sense of the distance between itself and the object. This is called
ranging. Figure 14.8 shows a bat using echolocation to sense distances.
Echolocating animals identify an object by comparing the relative intensity of the sound waves returning to each ear to figure
out the angle at which the sound waves were reflected. This gives information about the direction, size and shape of the object.
Since there is a slight distance in position between the two ears of an animal, the sound may return to one of the ears with a bit
of a delay, which also provides information about the position of the object. For example, if a bear is directly to the right of a bat,
the echo will return to the bat’s left ear later than to its right ear. If, however, the bear is directly ahead of the bat, the echo would
return to both ears at the same time. For an animal without a sense of sight such as a bat, it is important to know where other
animals are as well as what they are; their survival depends on it.
Principles of echolocation have been used to develop a variety of useful sensing technologies. SONAR, is used by submarines to
detect objects underwater and measure water depth. Unlike animal echolocation, which relies on only one transmitter (a mouth)
and two receivers (ears), manmade SONAR uses many transmitters and beams to get a more accurate reading of the
environment. Radar technologies use the echo of radio waves to locate clouds and storm systems in weather forecasting, and to
locate aircraft for air traffic control. Some new cars use echolocation technology to sense obstacles around the car, and warn the
driver who may be about to hit something (or even to automatically parallel park). Echolocation technologies and training
systems are being developed to help visually impaired people navigate their everyday environments.

Amplitude, Loudness and Energy of a Sound Wave

Figure 14.9 Noise on crowded roadways like this one in Delhi makes it hard to hear others unless they shout. (Lingaraj G J, Flickr)

In a quiet forest, you can sometimes hear a single leaf fall to the ground. But in a traffic jam filled with honking cars, you may
have to shout just so the person next to you can hear Figure 14.9.The loudness of a sound is related to how energetically its source
is vibrating. In cartoons showing a screaming person, the cartoonist often shows an open mouth with a vibrating uvula (the
hanging tissue at the back of the mouth) to represent a loud sound coming from the throat. Figure 14.10 shows such a cartoon
depiction of a bird loudly expressing its opinion.
A useful quantity for describing the loudness of sounds is called sound intensity. In general, the intensity of a wave is the power
per unit area carried by the wave. Power is the rate at which energy is transferred by the wave. In equation form, intensity I is
14.5
where P is the power through an area A. The SI unit for I is W/m2. The intensity of a sound depends upon its pressure amplitude.

423

424

Chapter 14 • Sound

The relationship between the intensity of a sound wave and its pressure amplitude (or pressure variation Δp) is
14.6
where ρ is the density of the material in which the sound wave travels, in units of kg/m3, and v is the speed of sound in the
medium, in units of m/s. Pressure amplitude has units of pascals (Pa) or N/m2. Note that Δp is half the difference between the
maximum and minimum pressure in the sound wave.
We can see from the equation that the intensity of a sound is proportional to its amplitude squared. The pressure variation is
proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation, and so I varies as (Δp)2. This relationship is consistent with the fact that the
sound wave is produced by some vibration; the greater its pressure amplitude, the more the air is compressed during the
vibration. Because the power of a sound wave is the rate at which energy is transferred, the energy of a sound wave is also
proportional to its amplitude squared.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

Pressure is usually denoted by capital P, but we are using a lowercase p for pressure in this case to distinguish it from power
P above.

Figure 14.10 Graphs of the pressures in two sound waves of different intensities. The more intense sound is produced by a source that has
larger-amplitude oscillations and has greater pressure maxima and minima. Because pressures are higher in the greater-intensity sound, it
can exert larger forces on the objects it encounters.

The Decibel Scale
You may have noticed that when people talk about the loudness of a sound, they describe it in units of decibels rather than watts
per meter squared. While sound intensity (in W/m2) is the SI unit, the sound intensity level in decibels (dB) is more relevant for
how humans perceive sounds. The way our ears perceive sound can be more accurately described by the logarithm of the
intensity of a sound rather than the intensity of a sound directly. The sound intensity level β is defined to be
14.7
where I is sound intensity in watts per meter squared, and I0 = 10–12 W/m2 is a reference intensity. I0 is chosen as the reference
point because it is the lowest intensity of sound a person with normal hearing can perceive. The decibel level of a sound having
an intensity of 10–12 W/m2 is β = 0 dB, because log10 1 = 0. That is, the threshold of human hearing is 0 decibels.
Each factor of 10 in intensity corresponds to 10 dB. For example, a 90 dB sound compared with a 60 dB sound is 30 dB greater, or
three factors of 10 (that is, 103 times) as intense. Another example is that if one sound is 107 as intense as another, it is 70 dB
higher.
Since β is defined in terms of a ratio, it is unit-less. The unit called decibel (dB) is used to indicate that this ratio is multiplied by
10. The sound intensity level is not the same as sound intensity—it tells you the level of the sound relative to a reference intensity
rather than the actual intensity.

People create sounds by pushing air up through their lungs and through elastic folds in the throat called vocal cords. These folds

open and close rhythmically, creating a pressure buildup. As air travels up and past the vocal cords, it causes them to vibrate.
This vibration escapes the mouth along with puffs of air as sound. A voice changes in pitch when the muscles of the larynx relax
or tighten, changing the tension on the vocal chords. A voice becomes louder when air flow from the lungs increases, making the
amplitude of the sound pressure wave greater.
Hearing is the perception of sound. It can give us plenty of information—such as pitch, loudness, and direction. Humans can
normally hear frequencies ranging from approximately 20 to 20,000 Hz. Other animals have hearing ranges different from that
of humans. Dogs can hear sounds as high as 45,000 Hz, whereas bats and dolphins can hear up to 110,000 Hz sounds. You may
have noticed that dogs respond to the sound of a dog whistle which produces sound out of the range of human hearing.
Sounds below 20 Hz are called infrasound, whereas those above 20,000 Hz are ultrasound. The perception of frequency is called
pitch, and the perception of intensity is called loudness.
The way we hear involves some interesting physics. The sound wave that hits our ear is a pressure wave. The ear converts sound
waves into electrical nerve impulses, similar to a microphone.
Figure 14.11 shows the anatomy of the ear with its division into three parts: the outer ear or ear canal; the middle ear, which runs
from the eardrum to the cochlea; and the inner ear, which is the cochlea itself. The body part normally referred to as the ear is
technically called the pinna.

Figure 14.11 The illustration shows the anatomy of the human ear.

The outer ear, or ear canal, carries sound to the eardrum protected inside of the ear. The middle ear converts sound into
mechanical vibrations and applies these vibrations to the cochlea. The lever system of the middle ear takes the force exerted on
the eardrum by sound pressure variations, amplifies it and transmits it to the inner ear via the oval window. Two muscles in the
middle ear protect the inner ear from very intense sounds. They react to intense sound in a few milliseconds and reduce the
force transmitted to the cochlea. This protective reaction can also be triggered by your own voice, so that humming during a
fireworks display, for example, can reduce noise damage.
Figure 14.12 shows the middle and inner ear in greater detail. As the middle ear bones vibrate, they vibrate the cochlea, which
contains fluid. This creates pressure waves in the fluid that cause the tectorial membrane to vibrate. The motion of the tectorial
membrane stimulates tiny cilia on specialized cells called hair cells. These hair cells, and their attached neurons, transform the
motion of the tectorial membrane into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.
The tectorial membrane vibrates at different positions based on the frequency of the incoming sound. This allows us to detect
the pitch of sound. Additional processing in the brain also allows us to determine which direction the sound is coming from
(based on comparison of the sound’s arrival time and intensity between our two ears).

Chapter 14 • Sound

Figure 14.12 The inner ear, or cochlea, is a coiled tube about 3 mm in diameter and 3 cm in length when uncoiled. As the stapes vibrates
against the oval window, it creates pressure waves that travel through fluid in the cochlea. These waves vibrate the tectorial membrane,
which bends the cilia and stimulates nerves in the organ of Corti. These nerves then send information about the sound to the brain.

FUN IN PHYSICS
Musical Instruments

Figure 14.13 Playing music, also known as “rocking out”, involves creating vibrations using musical instruments. (John Norton)

Yet another way that people make sounds is through playing musical instruments (see the previous figure). Recall that the
perception of frequency is called pitch. You may have noticed that the pitch range produced by an instrument tends to depend
upon its size. Small instruments, such as a piccolo, typically make high-pitch sounds, while larger instruments, such as a tuba,
typically make low-pitch sounds. High-pitch means small wavelength, and the size of a musical instrument is directly related to
the wavelengths of sound it produces. So a small instrument creates short-wavelength sounds, just as a large instrument creates
long-wavelength sounds.
Most of us have excellent relative pitch, which means that we can tell whether one sound has a different frequency from another.
We can usually distinguish one sound from another if the frequencies of the two sounds differ by as little as 1 Hz. For example,
500.0 and 501.5 Hz are noticeably different.
Musical notes are particular sounds that can be produced by most instruments, and are the building blocks of a song. In
Western music, musical notes have particular names, such as A-sharp, C, or E-flat. Some people can identify musical notes just
by listening to them. This rare ability is called perfect, or absolute, pitch.
When a violin plays middle C, there is no mistaking it for a piano playing the same note. The reason is that each instrument
produces a distinctive set of frequencies and intensities. We call our perception of these combinations of frequencies and
intensities the timbre of the sound. It is more difficult to quantify timbre than loudness or pitch. Timbre is more subjective.
Evocative adjectives such as dull, brilliant, warm, cold, pure, and rich are used to describe the timbre of a sound rather than

quantities with units, which makes for a difficult topic to dissect with physics. So the consideration of timbre takes us into the
realm of perceptual psychology, where higher-level processes in the brain are dominant. This is also true for other perceptions of
sound, such as music and noise. But as a teenager, you are likely already aware that one person’s music may be another person’s
noise.

The Doppler Effect of Sound Waves
The Doppler effect is a change in the observed pitch of a sound, due to relative motion between the source and the observer. An
example of the Doppler effect due to the motion of a source occurs when you are standing still, and the sound of a siren coming
from an ambulance shifts from high-pitch to low-pitch as it passes by. The closer the ambulance is to you, the more sudden the
shift. The faster the ambulance moves, the greater the shift. We also hear this shift in frequency for passing race cars, airplanes,
and trains. An example of the Doppler effect with a stationary source and moving observer is if you ride a train past a stationary
warning bell, you will hear the bell’s frequency shift from high to low as you pass by.
What causes the Doppler effect? Let’s compare three different scenarios: Sound waves emitted by a stationary source (Figure
14.14), sound waves emitted by a moving source (Figure 14.15), and sound waves emitted by a stationary source but heard by
moving observers (Figure 14.16). In each case, the sound spreads out from the point where it was emitted.
If the source and observers are stationary, then observers on either side see the same wavelength and frequency as emitted by
the source. But if the source is moving and continues to emit sound as it travels, then the air compressions (crests) become
closer together in the direction in which it’s traveling and farther apart in the direction it’s traveling away from. Therefore, the
wavelength is shorter in the direction the source is moving (on the right in Figure 14.15), and longer in the opposite direction (on
the left in Figure 14.15).
Finally, if the observers move, as in Figure 14.16, the frequency at which they receive the compressions changes. The observer
moving toward the source receives them at a higher frequency (and therefore shorter wavelength), and the person moving away
from the source receives them at a lower frequency (and therefore longer wavelength).

Figure 14.14 Sounds emitted by a source spread out in spherical waves. Because the source, observers, and air are stationary, the
wavelength and frequency are the same in all directions and to all observers.

Figure 14.15 Sounds emitted by a source moving to the right spread out from the points at which they were emitted. The wavelength is

14.3 • Doppler Effect and Sonic Booms

reduced and, consequently, the frequency is increased in the direction of motion, so that the observer on the right hears a higher-pitch
sound. The opposite is true for the observer on the left, where the wavelength is increased and the frequency is reduced.

Figure 14.16 The same effect is produced when the observers move relative to the source. Motion toward the source increases frequency
as the observer on the right passes through more wave crests than she would if stationary. Motion away from the source decreases
frequency as the observer on the left passes through fewer wave crests than he would if stationary.

We know that wavelength and frequency are related by
where v is the fixed speed of sound. The sound moves in a
medium and has the same speed v in that medium whether the source is moving or not. Therefore, f multiplied by is a
constant. Because the observer on the right in Figure 14.15 receives a shorter wavelength, the frequency she perceives must be
higher. Similarly, the observer on the left receives a longer wavelength and therefore perceives a lower frequency.
The same thing happens in Figure 14.16. A higher frequency is perceived by the observer moving toward the source, and a lower
frequency is perceived by an observer moving away from the source. In general, then, relative motion of source and observer
toward one another increases the perceived frequency. Relative motion apart decreases the perceived frequency. The greater the
relative speed is, the greater the effect.

sign is used for motion toward the observer and the plus sign for motion away from the observer.”
Note that the greater the speed of the source, the greater the Doppler effect. Similarly, for a stationary source and moving
observer, the frequency perceived by the observer fobs is given by
14.12
where vobs is the speed of the observer along a line joining the source and observer. Here the plus sign is for motion toward the
source, and the minus sign is for motion away from the source.

What happens to the sound produced by a moving source, such as a jet airplane, that approaches or even exceeds the speed of
sound? Suppose a jet airplane is coming nearly straight at you, emitting a sound of frequency fs. The greater the plane’s speed,
vs, the greater the Doppler shift and the greater the value of fobs. Now, as vs approaches the speed of sound, vw, fobs approaches
approaches zero.
infinity, because the denominator in
This result means that at the speed of sound, in front of the source, each wave is superimposed on the previous one because the
source moves forward at the speed of sound. The observer gets them all at the same instant, and so the frequency is theoretically
infinite. If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has passed, so that the
sounds from the source when it was approaching are stacked up with those from it when receding, creating a sonic boom. A
sonic boom is a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound.
An aircraft creates two sonic booms, one from its nose and one from its tail (see Figure 14.17). During television coverage of
space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the
shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not observe the aircraft creating the sonic boom, because it has
passed by before the shock wave reaches them. If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be
destructive enough to break windows. Because of this, supersonic flights are banned over populated areas of the United States.

Figure 14.17 Two sonic booms, created by the nose and tail of an aircraft, are observed on the ground after the plane has passed by.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculate Doppler Shift: A Train Horn

Suppose a train that has a 150 Hz horn is moving at 35 m/s in still air on a day when the speed of sound is 340 m/s. What
frequencies are observed by a stationary person at the side of the tracks as the train approaches and after it passes?
Strategy
To find the observed frequency,

must be used because the source is moving. The minus sign is used for the

approaching train, and the plus sign for the receding train.
Solution
(1) Enter known values into

to calculate the frequency observed by a stationary person as the train

approaches:

(2) Use the same equation but with the plus sign to find the frequency heard by a stationary person as the train recedes.

Discussion
The numbers calculated are valid when the train is far enough away that the motion is nearly along the line joining the train and
the observer. In both cases, the shift is significant and easily noticed. Note that the shift is approximately 20 Hz for motion
toward and approximately 10 Hz for motion away. The shifts are not symmetric.

Resonance and Beats
Sit in front of a piano sometime and sing a loud brief note at it while pushing down on the sustain pedal. It will sing the same
note back at you—the strings that have the same frequencies as your voice, are resonating in response to the forces from the
sound waves that you sent to them. This is a good example of the fact that objects—in this case, piano strings—can be forced to
oscillate but oscillate best at their natural frequency.
A driving force (such as your voice in the example) puts energy into a system at a certain frequency, which is not necessarily the
same as the natural frequency of the system. Over time the energy dissipates, and the amplitude gradually reduces to zero- this
is called damping. The natural frequency is the frequency at which a system would oscillate if there were no driving and no
damping force. The phenomenon of driving a system with a frequency equal to its natural frequency is called resonance, and a
system being driven at its natural frequency is said to resonate.
Most of us have played with toys where an object bobs up and down on an elastic band, something like the paddle ball suspended
from a finger in Figure 14.18. At first you hold your finger steady, and the ball bounces up and down with a small amount of
damping. If you move your finger up and down slowly, the ball will follow along without bouncing much on its own. As you
increase the frequency at which you move your finger up and down, the ball will respond by oscillating with increasing
amplitude. When you drive the ball at its natural frequency, the ball’s oscillations increase in amplitude with each oscillation for
as long as you drive it. As the driving frequency gets progressively higher than the resonant or natural frequency, the amplitude
of the oscillations becomes smaller, until the oscillations nearly disappear and your finger simply moves up and down with little
effect on the ball.

Figure 14.18 The paddle ball on its rubber band moves in response to the finger supporting it. If the finger moves with the natural
frequency of the ball on the rubber band, then a resonance is achieved, and the amplitude of the ball’s oscillations increases dramatically.
At higher and lower driving frequencies, energy is transferred to the ball less efficiently, and it responds with lower-amplitude oscillations.

Another example is that when you tune a radio, you adjust its resonant frequency so that it oscillates only at the desired station’s
broadcast (driving) frequency. Also, a child on a swing is driven (pushed) by a parent at the swing’s natural frequency to reach
the maximum amplitude (height). In all of these cases, the efficiency of energy transfer from the driving force into the oscillator
is best at resonance.

Chapter 14 • Sound

Figure 14.19 Some types of headphones use the phenomena of constructive and destructive interference to cancel out outside noises.

All sound resonances are due to constructive and destructive interference. Only the resonant frequencies interfere
constructively to form standing waves, while others interfere destructively and are absent. From the toot made by blowing over a
bottle to the recognizability of a great singer’s voice, resonance and standing waves play a vital role in sound.
Interference happens to all types of waves, including sound waves. In fact, one way to support that something is a wave is to
observe interference effects. Figure 14.19 shows a set of headphones that employs a clever use of sound interference to cancel
noise. To get destructive interference, a fast electronic analysis is performed, and a second sound is introduced with its maxima
and minima exactly reversed from the incoming noise.
In addition to resonance, superposition of waves can also create beats. Beats are produced by the superposition of two waves
with slightly different frequencies but the same amplitude. The waves alternate in time between constructive interference and
destructive interference, giving the resultant wave an amplitude that varies over time. (See the resultant wave in Figure 14.20).
This wave fluctuates in amplitude, or beats, with a frequency called the beat frequency. The equation for beat frequency is
14.13
where f1 and f2 are the frequencies of the two original waves. If the two frequencies of sound waves are similar, then what we
hear is an average frequency that gets louder and softer at the beat frequency.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Don’t confuse the beat frequency with the regular frequency of a wave resulting from superposition. While the beat
frequency is given by the formula above, and describes the frequency of the beats, the actual frequency of the wave resulting
from superposition is the average of the frequencies of the two original waves.

Figure 14.20 Beats are produced by the superposition of two waves of slightly different frequencies but identical amplitudes. The waves
alternate in time between constructive interference and destructive interference, giving the resulting wave a time-varying amplitude.

Fundamental Frequency and Harmonics
Suppose we hold a tuning fork near the end of a tube that is closed at the other end, as shown in Figure 14.21, Figure 14.22, and
Figure 14.23. If the tuning fork has just the right frequency, the air column in the tube resonates loudly, but at most frequencies
it vibrates very little. This means that the air column has only certain natural frequencies. The figures show how a resonance at
the lowest of these natural frequencies is formed. A disturbance travels down the tube at the speed of sound and bounces off the
closed end. If the tube is just the right length, the reflected sound arrives back at the tuning fork exactly half a cycle later, and it
interferes constructively with the continuing sound produced by the tuning fork. The incoming and reflected sounds form a
standing wave in the tube as shown.

Figure 14.21 Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. A disturbance moves down the tube.

Figure 14.22 Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. The disturbance reflects from the closed end of the
tube.

Figure 14.23 Resonance of air in a tube closed at one end, caused by a tuning fork. If the length of the tube L is just right, the disturbance
gets back to the tuning fork half a cycle later and interferes constructively with the continuing sound from the tuning fork. This interference
forms a standing wave, and the air column resonates.

The standing wave formed in the tube has its maximum air displacement (an antinode) at the open end, and no displacement (a

437

438

node) at the closed end. Recall from the last chapter on waves that motion is unconstrained at the antinode, and halted at the
node. The distance from a node to an antinode is one-fourth of a wavelength, and this equals the length of the tube; therefore,
. This same resonance can be produced by a vibration introduced at or near the closed end of the tube, as shown in
Figure 14.24.

Figure 14.24 The same standing wave is created in the tube by a vibration introduced near its closed end.

Since maximum air displacements are possible at the open end and none at the closed end, there are other, shorter wavelengths
that can resonate in the tube see Figure 14.25). Here the standing wave has three-fourths of its wavelength in the tube, or
, so that
. There is a whole series of shorter-wavelength and higher-frequency sounds that resonate
in the tube.
We use specific terms for the resonances in any system. The lowest resonant frequency is called the fundamental, while all
higher resonant frequencies are called overtones. All resonant frequencies are multiples of the fundamental, and are called
harmonics. The fundamental is the first harmonic, the first overtone is the second harmonic, and so on. Figure 14.26 shows the
fundamental and the first three overtones (the first four harmonics) in a tube closed at one end.

the first overtone.

The fundamental and overtones can be present at the same time in a variety of combinations. For example, the note middle C on
a trumpet sounds very different from middle C on a clarinet, even though both instruments are basically modified versions of a

tube closed at one end. The fundamental frequency is the same (and usually the most intense), but the overtones and their mix
of intensities are different. This mix is what gives musical instruments (and human voices) their distinctive characteristics,
whether they have air columns, strings, or drumheads. In fact, much of our speech is determined by shaping the cavity formed
by the throat and mouth and positioning the tongue to adjust the fundamental and combination of overtones.

Open-Pipe and Closed-Pipe Resonators
The resonant frequencies of a tube closed at one end (known as a closed-pipe resonator) are
where f1 is the fundamental, f3 is the first overtone, and so on. Note that the resonant frequencies depend on the speed of sound
v and on the length of the tube L.
Another type of tube is one that is open at both ends (known as an open-pipe resonator). Examples are some organ pipes, flutes,
and oboes. The air columns in tubes open at both ends have maximum air displacements at both ends. (See Figure 14.27).
Standing waves form as shown.

Figure 14.27 The resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are shown, including the fundamental and the first three overtones. In
all cases the maximum air displacements occur at both ends of the tube, giving it different natural frequencies than a tube closed at one
end.

The resonant frequencies of an open-pipe resonator are

where f1 is the fundamental, f2 is the first overtone, f3 is the second overtone, and so on. Note that a tube open at both ends has a
fundamental frequency twice what it would have if closed at one end. It also has a different spectrum of overtones than a tube
closed at one end. So if you had two tubes with the same fundamental frequency but one was open at both ends and the other
was closed at one end, they would sound different when played because they have different overtones.
Middle C, for example, would sound richer played on an open tube since it has more overtones. An open-pipe resonator has
more overtones than a closed-pipe resonator because it has even multiples of the fundamental as well as odd, whereas a closed
tube has only odd multiples.
In this section we have covered resonance and standing waves for wind instruments, but vibrating strings on stringed
instruments also resonate and have fundamentals and overtones similar to those for wind instruments.

Discussion
Many wind instruments are modified tubes that have finger holes, valves, and other devices for changing the length of the
resonating air column and therefore, the frequency of the note played. Horns producing very low frequencies, such as tubas,
require tubes so long that they are coiled into loops.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Finding the Third Overtone in an Open-Pipe Resonator

If a tube that’s open at both ends has a fundamental frequency of 120 Hz, what is the frequency of its third overtone?
Strategy
Since we already know the value of the fundamental frequency (n = 1), we can solve for the third overtone (n = 4) using the

equation
Solution
Since fundamental frequency (n = 1) is

and
14.18
Discussion
To solve this problem, it wasn’t necessary to know the length of the tube or the speed of the air because of the relationship
between the fundamental and the third overtone. This example was of an open-pipe resonator; note that for a closed-pipe
resonator, the third overtone has a value of n = 7 (not n = 4).

Using Beat Frequency to Tune a Piano

Piano tuners use beats routinely in their work. When comparing a note with a tuning fork, they listen for beats and adjust the
string until the beats go away (to zero frequency). If a piano tuner hears two beats per second, and the tuning fork has a

Strategy
Since we already know that the beat frequency fB is 2, and one of the frequencies (let’s say f2) is 256 Hz, we can use the equation

Discussion
The piano tuner might not initially be able to tell simply by listening whether the frequency of the piano is too high or too low
and must tune it by trial and error, making an adjustment and then testing it again. If there are even more beats after the
adjustment, then the tuner knows that he went in the wrong direction.

SECTION SUMMARY
14.1 Speed of Sound, Frequency,
and Wavelength
• Sound is one type of wave.
• Sound is a disturbance of matter that is transmitted
from its source outward in the form of longitudinal
waves.
• The relationship of the speed of sound v, its frequency f,
, which is the
and its wavelength is given by
same relationship given for all waves.
• The speed of sound depends upon the medium through
which the sound wave is travelling.
• In a given medium at a specific temperature (or
density), the speed of sound v is the same for all
frequencies and wavelengths.

14.2 Sound Intensity and Sound
Level
• The intensity of a sound is proportional to its amplitude
squared.
• The energy of a sound wave is also proportional to its
amplitude squared.
• Sound intensity level in decibels (dB) is more relevant
for how humans perceive sounds than sound intensity
(in W/m2), even though sound intensity is the SI unit.
• Sound intensity level is not the same as sound
intensity—it tells you the level of the sound relative to a
reference intensity rather than the actual intensity.
• Hearing is the perception of sound and involves that
transformation of sound waves into vibrations of parts
within the ear. These vibrations are then transformed

into neural signals that are interpreted by the brain.
• People create sounds by pushing air up through their
lungs and through elastic folds in the throat called vocal
cords.

14.3 Doppler Effect and Sonic
Booms
• The Doppler effect is a shift in the observed frequency of
a sound due to motion of either the source or the
observer.
• The observed frequency is greater than the actual
source’s frequency when the source and the observer are
moving closer together, either by the source moving
toward the observer or the observer moving toward the
source.
• A sonic boom is constructive interference of sound
created by an object moving faster than sound.

14.4 Sound Interference and
Resonance
• A system’s natural frequency is the frequency at which
the system will oscillate if not affected by driving or
damping forces.
• A periodic force driving a harmonic oscillator at its
natural frequency produces resonance. The system is
said to resonate.
• Beats occur when waves of slightly different frequencies
are superimposed.
• In air columns, the lowest-frequency resonance is called
the fundamental, whereas all higher resonant
frequencies are called overtones. Collectively, they are

14.2 Sound Intensity and Sound Level
15. Which property of the wave is related to its intensity?
How?
a. The frequency of the wave is related to the intensity
of the sound. The larger-frequency oscillations
indicate greater pressure maxima and minima, and
the pressure is higher in greater-intensity sound.
b. The wavelength of the wave is related to the
intensity of the sound. The longer-wavelength
oscillations indicate greater pressure maxima and
minima, and the pressure is higher in greaterintensity sound.
c. The amplitude of the wave is related to the intensity
of the sound. The larger-amplitude oscillations
indicate greater pressure maxima and minima, and
the pressure is higher in greater-intensity sound.
d. The speed of the wave is related to the intensity of
the sound. The higher-speed oscillations indicate
greater pressure maxima and minima, and the
pressure is higher in greater-intensity sound.
16. Why is decibel (dB) used to describe loudness of sound?

14.3 Doppler Effect and Sonic Booms
19. When the source of sound is moving through the air,
does the speed of sound change with respect to a
stationary person standing nearby?
a. Yes
b. No
20. Why is no sound heard by the observer when an object
approaches him at a speed faster than that of sound?
a. If the source exceeds the speed of sound, then
destructive interference occurs and no sound is
heard by the observer when an object approaches
him.
b. If the source exceeds the speed of sound, the
frequency of sound produced is beyond the audible
range of sound.
c. If the source exceeds the speed of sound, all the
sound waves produced approach minimum
intensity and no sound is heard by the observer
when an object approaches him.
d. If the source exceeds the speed of sound, all the
sound waves produced are behind the source.
Hence, the observer hears the sound only after the
source has passed.
21. Does the Doppler effect occur when the source and
observer are both moving towards each other? If so, how
would this affect the perceived frequency?
a. Yes, the perceived frequency will be even lower in
this case than if only one of the two were moving.
b. No, the Doppler effect occurs only when an
observer is moving towards a source.

moving towards an observer.

58. When a passing driver has his stereo turned up, you
cannot even hear what the person next to you is saying.
Why is this so?
a. The sound from the passing car’s stereo has a
higher amplitude and hence higher intensity
compared to the intensity of the sound coming

15.2 The Behavior of Electromagnetic Radiation

INTRODUCTION The beauty of a coral reef, the warm radiance of sunshine, the sting of sunburn, the X-ray revealing a broken
bone, even microwave popcorn—all are brought to us by electromagnetic waves. The list of the various types of electromagnetic
waves, ranging from radio transmission waves to nuclear gamma-ray (γ-ray) emissions, is interesting in itself.
Even more intriguing is that all of these different phenomena are manifestations of the same thing—electromagnetic waves (see
Figure 15.1). What are electromagnetic waves? How are they created, and how do they travel? How can we understand their
widely varying properties? What is the relationship between electric and magnetic effects? These and other questions will be

Chapter 15 • Light

The Electromagnetic Spectrum
We generally take light for granted, but it is a truly amazing and mysterious form of energy. Think about it: Light travels to Earth
across millions of kilometers of empty space. When it reaches us, it interacts with matter in various ways to generate almost all
the energy needed to support life, provide heat, and cause weather patterns. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation
(EMR). The term light usually refers to visible light, but this is not the only form of EMR. As we will see, visible light occupies a
narrow band in a broad range of types of electromagnetic radiation.
Electromagnetic radiation is generated by a moving electric charge, that is, by an electric current. As you will see when you
study electricity, an electric current generates both an electric field, E, and a magnetic field, B. These fields are perpendicular to
each other. When the moving charge oscillates, as in an alternating current, an EM wave is propagated. Figure 15.2 shows how
an electromagnetic wave moves away from the source—indicated by the ~ symbol.

15.1 • The Electromagnetic Spectrum

Figure 15.2 A part of the electromagnetic wave sent out from an oscillating charge at one instant in time. The electric and magnetic fields
(E and B) are in phase, and they are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. For clarity, the waves are shown only
along one direction, but they propagate out in other directions too.

From your study of sound waves, recall these features that apply to all types of waves:
• Wavelength—The distance between two wave crests or two wave troughs, expressed in various metric measures of distance
• Frequency—The number of wave crests that pass a point per second, expressed in hertz (Hz or s–1)
• Amplitude: The height of the crest above the null point
As mentioned, electromagnetic radiation takes several forms. These forms are characterized by a range of frequencies. Because
frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, any form of EMR can also be represented by its range of wavelengths. Figure
15.3 shows the frequency and wavelength ranges of various types of EMR. With how many of these types are you familiar?

Figure 15.3 The electromagnetic spectrum, showing the major categories of electromagnetic waves. The range of frequencies and
wavelengths is remarkable. The dividing line between some categories is distinct, whereas other categories overlap.

Take a few minutes to study the positions of the various types of radiation on the EM spectrum, above. Sometimes all radiation
with frequencies lower than those of visible light are referred to as infrared (IR) radiation. This includes radio waves, which
overlap with the frequencies used for media broadcasts of TV and radio signals. The microwave radiation that you see on the
diagram is the same radiation that is used in a microwave oven. What we feel as radiant heat is also a form of low-frequency
EMR.
All the high-frequency radiation to the right of visible light is sometimes referred to as ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This includes
X-rays and gamma (γ) rays. The narrow band that is visible light extends from lower-frequency red light to higher-frequency
violet light, thus the terms are infrared (below red) and ultraviolet (beyond violet).

BOUNDLESS PHYSICS
Maxwell’s Equations

The Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) is regarded widely to have been the greatest theoretical physicist of the

457

458

Chapter 15 • Light

nineteenth century. Although he died young, Maxwell not only formulated a complete electromagnetic theory, represented by
Maxwell’s equations, he also developed the kinetic theory of gases, and made significant contributions to the understanding of
color vision and the nature of Saturn’s rings.
Maxwell brought together all the work that had been done by brilliant physicists, such as Ørsted, Coulomb, Ampere, Gauss, and
Faraday, and added his own insights to develop the overarching theory of electromagnetism. Maxwell’s equations are
paraphrased here in words because their mathematical content is beyond the level of this text. However, the equations illustrate
how apparently simple mathematical statements can elegantly unite and express a multitude of concepts—why mathematics is
the language of science.
Maxwell’s Equations
1. Electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges. The electric field is defined as the force
per unit charge on a test charge, and the strength of the force is related to the electric constant, ε0.
2. Magnetic field lines are continuous, having no beginning or end. No magnetic monopoles are known to exist. The strength
of the magnetic force is related to the magnetic constant, μ0.
3. A changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (emf) and, hence, an electric field. The direction of the emf
opposes the change, changing direction of the magnetic field.
4. Magnetic fields are generated by moving charges or by changing electric fields.
Maxwell’s complete theory shows that electric and magnetic forces are not separate, but different manifestations of the same
thing—the electromagnetic force. This classical unification of forces is one motivation for current attempts to unify the four
basic forces in nature—the gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces. The weak nuclear and
electromagnetic forces have been unified, and further unification with the strong nuclear force is expected; but, the unification
of the gravitational force with the other three has proven to be a real head-scratcher.
One final accomplishment of Maxwell was his development in 1855 of a process that could produce color photographic images.
In 1861, he and photographer Thomas Sutton worked together on this process. The color image was achieved by projecting red,
blue, and green light through black-and-white photographs of a tartan ribbon, each photo itself exposed in different-colored
light. The final image was projected onto a screen (see Figure 15.4).

Figure 15.4 Maxwell and Sutton’s photograph of a colored ribbon. This was the first durable color photograph. The plaid tartan of the Scots
made a colorful photographic subject.

travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. The basic difference between types of radiation is their differing frequencies. Each
frequency has an associated wavelength. As frequency increases across the spectrum, wavelength decreases. Energy also
increases with frequency. Because of this, higher frequencies penetrate matter more readily. Some of the properties and uses of
the various EM spectrum bands are listed in Table 15.1.

As a child, you probably learned the color wheel, shown on the left in Figure 15.6. It helps if you know what color results when
you mix different colors of paint together. Mixing two of the primary pigment colors—magenta, yellow, or cyan—together
results in a secondary color. For example, mixing cyan and yellow makes green. This is called subtractive color mixing. Mixing
different colors of light together is quite different. The diagram on the right shows additive color mixing. In this case, the
primary colors are red, green, and blue, and the secondary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow. Mixing pigments and mixing
light are different because materials absorb light by a different set of rules than does the perception of light by the eye. Notice
that, when all colors are subtracted, the result is no color, or black. When all colors are added, the result is white light. We see
the reverse of this when white sunlight is separated into the visible spectrum by a prism or by raindrops when a rainbow appears
in the sky.

LINKS TO PHYSICS
Animal Color Perception

The physics of color perception has interesting links to zoology. Other animals have very different views of the world than
humans, especially with respect to which colors can be seen. Color is detected by cells in the eye called cones. Humans have
three cones that are sensitive to three different ranges of electromagnetic wavelengths. They are called red, blue, and green
cones, although these colors do not correspond exactly to the centers of the three ranges. The ranges of wavelengths that each
cone detects are red, 500 to 700 nm; green, 450 to 630 nm; and blue, 400 to 500 nm.
Most primates also have three kinds of cones and see the world much as we do. Most mammals other than primates only have
two cones and have a less colorful view of things. Dogs, for example see blue and yellow, but are color blind to red and green. You
might think that simpler species, such as fish and insects, would have less sophisticated vision, but this is not the case. Many
birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects have four or five different cones in their eyes. These species don’t have a wider range of
perceived colors, but they see more hues, or combinations of colors. Also, some animals, such as bees or rattlesnakes, see a

range of colors that is as broad as ours, but shifted into the ultraviolet or infrared.
These differences in color perception are generally adaptations that help the animals survive. Colorful tropical birds and fish
display some colors that are too subtle for us to see. These colors are believed to play a role in the species mating rituals. Figure
15.7 shows the colors visible and the color range of vision in humans, bees, and dogs.

Figure 15.7 Humans, bees, and dogs see colors differently. Dogs see fewer colors than humans, and bees see a different range of colors.

a. Bulls are color-blind to every color in the spectrum of colors.
b. Bulls are color-blind to the blue colors in the spectrum of colors.
c. Bulls are color-blind to the red colors in the spectrum of colors.
d. Bulls are color-blind to the green colors in the spectrum of colors.

Humans have found uses for every part of the electromagnetic spectrum. We will take a look at the uses of each range of
frequencies, beginning with visible light. Most of our uses of visible light are obvious; without it our interaction with our
surroundings would be much different. We might forget that nearly all of our food depends on the photosynthesis process in
plants, and that the energy for this process comes from the visible part of the spectrum. Without photosynthesis, we would also
have almost no oxygen in the atmosphere.
The low-frequency, infrared region of the spectrum has many applications in media broadcasting. Television, radio, cell phone,
and remote-control devices all broadcast and/or receive signals with these wavelengths. AM and FM radio signals are both lowfrequency radiation. They are in different regions of the spectrum, but that is not their basic difference. AM and FM are
abbreviations for amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. Information in AM signals has the form of changes in
amplitude of the radio waves; information in FM signals has the form of changes in wave frequency.
Another application of long-wavelength radiation is found in microwave ovens. These appliances cook or warm food by
irradiating it with EM radiation in the microwave frequency range. Most kitchen microwaves use a frequency of
Hz. These waves have the right amount of energy to cause polar molecules, such as water, to rotate faster. Polar molecules are
those that have a partial charge separation. The rotational energy of these molecules is given up to surrounding matter as heat.
The first microwave ovens were called Radaranges because they were based on radar technology developed during World War II.
Radar uses radiation with wavelengths similar to those of microwaves to detect the location and speed of distant objects, such as
airplanes, weather formations, and motor vehicles. Radar information is obtained by receiving and analyzing the echoes of
microwaves reflected by an object. The speed of the object can be measured using the Doppler shift of the returning waves. This
is the same effect you learned about when you studied sound waves. Like sound waves, EM waves are shifted to higher
frequencies by an object moving toward an observer, and to lower frequencies by an object moving away from the observer.
Astronomers use this same Doppler effect to measure the speed at which distant galaxies are moving away from us. In this case,
the shift in frequency is called the red shift, because visible frequencies are shifted toward the lower-frequency, red end of the
spectrum.

Chapter 15 • Light

Exposure to any radiation with frequencies greater than those of visible light carries some health hazards. All types of radiation
in this range are known to cause cell damage. The danger is related to the high energy and penetrating ability of these EM waves.
The likelihood of being harmed by any of this radiation depends largely on the amount of exposure. Most people try to reduce
exposure to UV radiation from sunlight by using sunscreen and protective clothing. Physicians still use X-rays to diagnose
medical problems, but the intensity of the radiation used is extremely low. Figure 15.8 shows an X-ray image of a patient’s chest
cavity.
One medical-imaging technique that involves no danger of exposure is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is an important
imaging and research tool in medicine, producing highly detailed two- and three-dimensional images. Radio waves are
broadcast, absorbed, and reemitted in a resonance process that is sensitive to the density of nuclei, usually hydrogen
nuclei—protons.

In a vacuum, all electromagnetic radiation travels at the same incredible speed of 3.00 × 108 m/s, which is equal to 671 million
miles per hour. This is one of the fundamental physical constants. It is referred to as the speed of light and is given the symbol c.
The space between celestial bodies is a near vacuum, so the light we see from the Sun, stars, and other planets has traveled here
at the speed of light. Keep in mind that all EM radiation travels at this speed. All the different wavelengths of radiation that leave
the Sun make the trip to Earth in the same amount of time. That trip takes 8.3 minutes. Light from the nearest star, besides the
Sun, takes 4.2 years to reach Earth, and light from the nearest galaxy—a dwarf galaxy that orbits the Milky Way—travels 25,000
years on its way to Earth. You can see why we call very long distances astronomical.
When light travels through a physical medium, its speed is always less than the speed of light. For example, light travels in water
at three-fourths the value of c. In air, light has a speed that is just slightly slower than in empty space: 99.97 percent of c.
Diamond slows light down to just 41 percent of c. When light changes speeds at a boundary between media, it also changes
direction. The greater the difference in speeds, the more the path of light bends. In other chapters, we look at this bending,
called refraction, in greater detail. We introduce refraction here to help explain a phenomenon called thin-film interference.
Have you ever wondered about the rainbow colors you often see on soap bubbles, oil slicks, and compact discs? This occurs when
light is both refracted by and reflected from a very thin film. The diagram shows the path of light through such a thin film. The
symbols n1, n2, and n3 indicate that light travels at different speeds in each of the three materials. Learn more about this topic in
the chapter on diffraction and interference.
Figure 15.9 shows the result of thin film interference on the surface of soap bubbles. Because ray 2 travels a greater distance, the
two rays become out of phase. That is, the crests of the two emerging waves are no longer moving together. This causes
interference, which reinforces the intensity of the wavelengths of light that create the bands of color. The color bands are
separated because each color has a different wavelength. Also, the thickness of the film is not uniform, and different thicknesses
cause colors of different wavelengths to interfere in different places. Note that the film must be very, very thin—somewhere in
the vicinity of the wavelengths of visible light.

Chapter 15 • Light

Figure 15.9 Light striking a thin film is partially reflected (ray 1) and partially refracted at the top surface. The refracted ray is partially
reflected at the bottom surface and emerges as ray 2. These rays will interfere in a way that depends on the thickness of the film and the
indices of refraction of the various media.

You have probably experienced how polarized sunglasses reduce glare from the surface of water or snow. The effect is caused by
the wave nature of light. Looking back at , we see that the electric field moves in only one direction perpendicular to the
direction of propagation. Light from most sources vibrates in all directions perpendicular to propagation. Light with an electric
field that vibrates in only one direction is called polarized. A diagram of polarized light would look like .
Polarized glasses are an example of a polarizing filter. These glasses absorb most of the horizontal light waves and transmit the
vertical waves. This cuts down glare, which is caused by horizontal waves. Figure 15.10 shows how waves traveling along a rope
can be used as a model of how a polarizing filter works. The oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane and are said to be
vertically polarized. Those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane and are horizontally polarized. If a vertical slit is placed on
the first rope, the waves pass through. However, a vertical slit blocks the horizontally polarized waves. For EM waves, the
direction of the electric field oscillation is analogous to the disturbances on the ropes.

Figure 15.10 The transverse oscillations in one rope are in a vertical plane, and those in the other rope are in a horizontal plane. The first is
said to be vertically polarized, and the other is said to be horizontally polarized. Vertical slits pass vertically polarized waves and block
horizontally polarized waves.

Light can also be polarized by reflection. Most of the light reflected from water, glass, or any highly reflective surface is polarized
horizontally. Figure 15.11 shows the effect of a polarizing lens on light reflected from the surface of water.

water. Part (b) of this figure was taken with a polarizing filter and part (a) was taken without. As a result, the reflection of clouds and sky
observed in part (a) is not observed in part (b). Polarizing sunglasses are particularly useful on snow and water.

Quantitative Treatment of Electromagnetic Waves
We can use the speed of light, c, to carry out several simple but interesting calculations. If we know the distance to a celestial
object, we can calculate how long it takes its light to reach us. Of course, we can also make the reverse calculation if we know the
time it takes for the light to travel to us. For an object at a very great distance from Earth, it takes many years for its light to reach
us. This means that we are looking at the object as it existed in the distant past. The object may, in fact, no longer exist. Very
large distances in the universe are measured in light years. One light year is the distance that light travels in one year, which is
kilometers or
miles (…and 1012 is a trillion!).

Discussion
Manipulating exponents of 10 in a fraction can be tricky. Be sure you keep track of the + and – exponents correctly. Checking
back to the diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum in the previous section shows that 1014 is a reasonable order of magnitude
for the frequency of yellow light.
The frequency of a wave is proportional to the energy the wave carries. The actual proportionality constant will be discussed in a
later chapter. Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, we also know that wavelength is inversely proportional to
energy. Keep these relationships in mind as general rules.
The rate at which light is radiated from a source is called luminous flux, P, and it is measured in lumens (lm). Energy-saving
light bulbs, which provide more luminous flux for a given use of electricity, are now available. One of these bulbs is called a
compact fluorescent lamp; another is an LED (light-emitting diode) bulb. If you wanted to replace an old incandescent bulb with
an energy saving bulb, you would want the new bulb to have the same brightness as the old one. To compare bulbs accurately,
you would need to compare the lumens each one puts out. Comparing wattage—that is, the electric power used—would be

15.2 • The Behavior of Electromagnetic Radiation

misleading. Both wattage and lumens are stated on the packaging.
The luminous flux of a bulb might be 2,000 lm. That accounts for all the light radiated in all directions. However, what we really
need to know is how much light falls on an object, such as a book, at a specific distance. The number of lumens per square meter
is called illuminance, and is given in units of lux (lx). Picture a light bulb in the middle of a sphere with a 1-m radius. The total
surface of the sphere equals 4πr2 m2. The illuminance then is given by
15.4
What happens if the radius of the sphere is increased 2 m? The illuminance is now only one-fourth as great, because the r2 term
in the denominator is 4 instead of 1. Figure 15.12 shows how illuminance decreases with the inverse square of the distance.

Figure 15.12 The diagram shows why the illuminance varies inversely with the square of the distance from a source of light.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating Illuminance

A woman puts a new bulb in a floor lamp beside an easy chair. If the luminous flux of the bulb is rated at 2,000 lm, what is the
illuminance on a book held 2.00 m from the bulb?
STRATEGY
Choose the equation and list the knowns.
Equation:

P = 2,000 lm
π = 3.14

r = 2.00 m
Solution
Substitute the known values into the equation.

Discussion
Try some other distances to illustrate how greatly light fades with distance from its source. For example, at 3 m the illuminance
is only 17.7 lux. Parents often scold children for reading in light that is too dim. Instead of shouting, “You’ll ruin your eyes!” it
might be better to explain the inverse square law of illuminance to the child.

INTRODUCTION “In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room.”
—Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carol

Through the Looking Glass tells of the adventures of Alice after she steps from the real world, through a mirror, and into the
virtual world. In this chapter we examine the optical meanings of real and virtual, as well as other concepts that make up the
field of optics.
The light from this page or screen is formed into an image by the lens of your eyes, much as the lens of the camera that made the
photograph at the beginning of this chapter. Mirrors, like lenses, can also form images, which in turn are captured by your eyes.
Optics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of visible light and other electromagnetic waves. For now, we
concentrate on the propagation of light and its interaction with matter.
It is convenient to divide optics into two major parts based on the size of objects that light encounters. When light interacts with
an object that is several times as large as the light’s wavelength, its observable behavior is similar to a ray; it does not display its

wave characteristics prominently. We call this part of optics geometric optics. This chapter focuses on situations for which
geometric optics is suited.

Characteristics of Mirrors
There are three ways, as shown in Figure 16.2, in which light can travel from a source to another location. It can come directly
from the source through empty space, such as from the Sun to Earth. Light can travel to an object through various media, such
as air and glass. Light can also arrive at an object after being reflected, such as by a mirror. In all these cases, light is modeled as
traveling in a straight line, called a ray. Light may change direction when it encounters the surface of a different material (such
as a mirror) or when it passes from one material to another (such as when passing from air into glass). It then continues in a
straight line—that is, as a ray. The word ray comes from mathematics. Here it means a straight line that originates from some
point. It is acceptable to visualize light rays as laser rays (or even science fiction depictions of ray guns).

Figure 16.2 Three methods for light to travel from a source to another location are shown. (a) Light reaches the upper atmosphere of Earth
by traveling through empty space directly from the source (the Sun). (b) This light can reach a person in one of two ways. It can travel
through a medium, such as air or glass, and typically travels from one medium to another. It can also reflect from an object, such as a
mirror.

Because light moves in straight lines, that is, as rays, and changes directions when it interacts with matter, it can be described
through geometry and trigonometry. This part of optics, described by straight lines and angles, is therefore called geometric
optics. There are two laws that govern how light changes direction when it interacts with matter: the law of reflection, for
situations in which light bounces off matter; and the law of refraction, for situations in which light passes through matter. In
this section, we consider the geometric optics of reflection.
Whenever we look into a mirror or squint at sunlight glinting from a lake, we are seeing a reflection. How does the reflected
light travel from the object to your eyes? The law of reflection states: The angle of reflection, , equals the angle of incidence,

16.1 • Reflection

. This law governs the behavior of all waves when they interact with a smooth surface, and therefore describe the behavior of
light waves as well. The reflection of light is simplified when light is treated as a ray. This concept is illustrated in Figure 16.3,
which also shows how the angles are measured relative to the line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray
strikes it. This perpendicular line is also called the normal line, or just the normal. Light reflected in this way is referred to as
specular (from the Latin word for mirror: speculum).
We expect to see reflections from smooth surfaces, but Figure 16.4, illustrates how a rough surface reflects light. Because the
light is reflected from different parts of the surface at different angles, the rays go in many different directions, so the reflected
light is diffused. Diffused light allows you to read a printed page from almost any angle because some of the rays go in different
directions. Many objects, such as people, clothing, leaves, and walls, have rough surfaces and can be seen from many angles. A
mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface and reflects light at specific angles.

Figure 16.3 The law of reflection states that the angle of reflection, θr, equals the angle of incidence, θi. The angles are measured relative
to the line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the ray strikes the surface. The incident and reflected rays, along with the
normal, lie in the same plane.

Figure 16.4 Light is diffused when it reflects from a rough surface. Here, many parallel rays are incident, but they are reflected at many
different angles because the surface is rough.

When we see ourselves in a mirror, it appears that our image is actually behind the mirror. We see the light coming from a
direction determined by the law of reflection. The angles are such that our image is exactly the same distance behind the mirror,
di, as the distance we stand away from the mirror, do. Although these mirror images make objects appear to be where they
cannot be (such as behind a solid wall), the images are not figments of our imagination. Mirror images can be photographed and
videotaped by instruments and look just as they do to our eyes, which are themselves optical instruments. An image in a mirror
is said to be a virtual image, as opposed to a real image. A virtual image is formed when light rays appear to diverge from a
point without actually doing so.
Figure 16.5 helps illustrate how a flat mirror forms an image. Two rays are shown emerging from the same point, striking the
mirror, and reflecting into the observer’s eye. The rays can diverge slightly, and both still enter the eye. If the rays are
extrapolated backward, they seem to originate from a common point behind the mirror, allowing us to locate the image. The
paths of the reflected rays into the eye are the same as if they had come directly from that point behind the mirror. Using the law
of reflection—the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence—we can see that the image and object are the same distance
from the mirror. This is a virtual image, as defined earlier.

Figure 16.5 When two sets of rays from common points on an object are reflected by a flat mirror into the eye of an observer, the reflected
rays seem to originate from behind the mirror, which determines the position of the virtual image.

FUN IN PHYSICS
Mirror Mazes

Figure 16.6 is a chase scene from an old silent film called The Circus, starring Charlie Chaplin. The chase scene takes place in a
mirror maze. You may have seen such a maze at an amusement park or carnival. Finding your way through the maze can be very
difficult. Keep in mind that only one image in the picture is real—the others are virtual.

Figure 16.6 Charlie Chaplin is in a mirror maze. Which image is real?

One of the earliest uses of mirrors for creating the illusion of space is seen in the Palace of Versailles, the former home of French
royalty. Construction of the Hall of Mirrors (Figure 16.7) began in 1678. It is still one of the most popular tourist attractions at
Versailles.

Virtual Image

This video explains the creation of virtual images in a mirror. It shows the location and orientation of the images using ray
diagrams, and relates the perception to the human eye.
Click to view content (https://openstax.org/l/28Virtualimage)
Compare the distance of an object from a mirror to the apparent distance of its virtual image behind the mirror.
a. The distances of the image and the object from the mirror are the same.
b. The distances of the image and the object from the mirror are always different.
c. The image is formed at infinity if the object is placed near the mirror.
d. The image is formed near the mirror if the object is placed at infinity.
Some mirrors are curved instead of flat. A mirror that curves inward is called a concave mirror, whereas one that curves
outward is called a convex mirror. Pick up a well-polished metal spoon and you can see an example of each type of curvature.
The side of the spoon that holds the food is a concave mirror; the back of the spoon is a convex mirror. Observe your image on
both sides of the spoon.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

You can remember the difference between concave and convex by thinking, Concave means caved in.
Ray diagrams can be used to find the point where reflected rays converge or appear to converge, or the point from which rays
appear to diverge. This is called the focal point, F. The distance from F to the mirror along the central axis (the line
perpendicular to the center of the mirror’s surface) is called the focal length, f. Figure 16.9 shows the focal points of concave and
convex mirrors.

481

482

Chapter 16 • Mirrors and Lenses

Figure 16.9 (a, b) The focal length for the concave mirror in (a), formed by converging rays, is in front of the mirror, and has a positive value.
The focal length for the convex mirror in (b), formed by diverging rays, appears to be behind the mirror, and has a negative value.

Images formed by a concave mirror vary, depending on which side of the focal point the object is placed. For any object placed
on the far side of the focal point with respect to the mirror, the rays converge in front of the mirror to form a real image, which
can be projected onto a surface, such as a screen or sheet of paper However, for an object located inside the focal point with
respect to the concave mirror, the image is virtual. For a convex mirror the image is always virtual—that is, it appears to be
behind the mirror. The ray diagrams in Figure 16.10 show how to determine the nature of the image formed by concave and
convex mirrors.

Parabolic Mirrors and Real Images

This video uses ray diagrams to show the special feature of parabolic mirrors that makes them ideal for either projecting light
energy in parallel rays, with the source being at the focal point of the parabola, or for collecting at the focal point light energy
from a distant source.

You should be able to notice everyday applications of curved mirrors. One common example is the use of security mirrors in
stores, as shown in Figure 16.11.

483

484

Chapter 16 • Mirrors and Lenses

Figure 16.11 Security mirrors are convex, producing a smaller, upright image. Because the image is smaller, a larger area is imaged
compared with what would be observed for a flat mirror; hence, security is improved. (credit: Laura D’Alessandro, Flickr)

Some telescopes also use curved mirrors and no lenses (except in the eyepieces) both to magnify images and to change the path
of light. Figure 16.12 shows a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. This design uses a spherical primary concave mirror and a convex
secondary mirror. The image is projected onto the focal plane by light passing through the perforated primary mirror. The
effective focal length of such a telescope is the focal length of the primary mirror multiplied by the magnification of the
secondary mirror. The result is a telescope with a focal length much greater than the length of the telescope itself.

Figure 16.12 This diagram shows the design of a Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope.

A parabolic concave mirror has the very useful property that all light from a distant source, on reflection by the mirror surface, is
directed to the focal point. Likewise, a light source placed at the focal point directs all the light it emits in parallel lines away
from the mirror. This case is illustrated by the ray diagram in Figure 16.13. The light source in a car headlight, for example, is
located at the focal point of a parabolic mirror.

Figure 16.13 The bulb in this ray diagram of a car headlight is located at the focal point of a parabolic mirror.

Parabolic mirrors are also used to collect sunlight and direct it to a focal point, where it is transformed into heat, which in turn
can be used to generate electricity. This application is shown in Figure 16.14.

16.1 • Reflection

Using a concave mirror, you look at the reflection of a faraway object. The image size changes if you move the object closer to the
mirror. Why does the image disappear entirely when the object is at the mirror's focal point?
a. The height of the image became infinite.
b. The height of the object became zero.
c. The intensity of intersecting light rays became zero.
d. The intensity of intersecting light rays increased.

The Application of the Curved Mirror Equations
Curved mirrors and the images they create involve a fairly small number of variables: the mirror’s radius of curvature, R; the
focal length, f; the distances of the object and image from the mirror, do and di, respectively; and the heights of the object and
image, ho and hi, respectively. The signs of these values indicate whether the image is inverted, erect (upright), real, or virtual.
We now look at the equations that relate these variables and apply them to everyday problems.
Figure 16.15 shows the meanings of most of the variables we will use for calculations involving curved mirrors.

Figure 16.15 Look for the variables, do, di, ho, hi, and f in this figure.

The basic equation that describes both lenses and mirrors is the lens/mirror equation

This equation can be rearranged several ways. For example, it may be written to solve for focal length.

Magnification, m, is the ratio of the size of the image, hi, to the size of the object, ho. The value of m can be calculated in two
ways.

This relationship can be written to solve for any of the variables involved. For example, the height of the image is given by

We saved the simplest equation for last. The radius of curvature of a curved mirror, R, is simply twice the focal length.

We can learn important information from the algebraic sign of the result of a calculation using the previous equations:
• A negative di indicates a virtual image; a positive value indicates a real image
• A negative hi indicates an inverted image; a positive value indicates an erect image
• For concave mirrors, f is positive; for convex mirrors, f is negative
Now let’s apply these equations to solve some problems.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating Focal Length

A person standing 6.0 m from a convex security mirror forms a virtual image that appears to be 1.0 m behind the mirror. What
is the focal length of the mirror?
STRATEGY
The person is the object, so do = 6.0 m. We know that, for this situation, do is positive. The image is virtual, so the value for the
image distance is negative, so di = –1.0 m.
Now, use the appropriate version of the lens/mirror equation to solve for focal length by substituting the known values.
Solution

Discussion
The negative result is expected for a convex mirror. This indicates the focal point is behind the mirror.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Calculating Object Distance

Electric room heaters use a concave mirror to reflect infrared (IR) radiation from hot coils. Note that IR radiation follows the
same law of reflection as visible light. Given that the mirror has a radius of curvature of 50.0 cm and produces an image of the
coils 3.00 m in front of the mirror, where are the coils with respect to the mirror?
STRATEGY
We are told that the concave mirror projects a real image of the coils at an image distance di = 3.00 m. The coils are the object,
and we are asked to find their location—that is, to find the object distance do. We are also given the radius of curvature of the
mirror, so that its focal length is f = R/2 = 25.0 cm (a positive value, because the mirror is concave, or converging). We can use the
lens/mirror equation to solve this problem.
Solution
Because di and f are known, the lens/mirror equation can be used to find do.
16.1
Rearranging to solve for do, we have
16.2
Entering the known quantities gives us
16.3
Discussion
Note that the object (the coil filament) is farther from the mirror than the mirror’s focal length. This is a case 1 image (do > f and f
positive), consistent with the fact that a real image is formed. You get the most concentrated thermal energy directly in front of
the mirror and 3.00 m away from it. In general, this is not desirable because it could cause burns. Usually, you want the rays to
emerge parallel, and this is accomplished by having the filament at the focal point of the mirror.
Note that the filament here is not much farther from the mirror than the focal length, and that the image produced is
considerably farther away.

The Law of Refraction
You may have noticed some odd optical phenomena when looking into a fish tank. For example, you may see the same fish
appear to be in two different places (Figure 16.16). This is because light coming to you from the fish changes direction when it

487

488

Chapter 16 • Mirrors and Lenses

leaves the tank and, in this case, light rays traveling along two different paths both reach our eyes. The changing of a light ray’s
direction (loosely called bending) when it passes a boundary between materials of different composition, or between layers in
single material where there are changes in temperature and density, is called refraction. Refraction is responsible for a
tremendous range of optical phenomena, from the action of lenses to voice transmission through optical fibers.

Figure 16.16 Looking at the fish tank as shown, we can see the same fish in two different locations, because light changes directions when
it passes from water to air. In this case, light rays traveling on two different paths change direction as they travel from water to air, and so
reach the observer. Consequently, the fish appears to be in two different places. This bending of light is called refraction and is responsible
for many optical phenomena.

Why does light change direction when passing from one material (medium) to another? It is because light changes speed when
going from one material to another. This behavior is typical of all waves and is especially easy to apply to light because light
waves have very small wavelengths, and so they can be treated as rays. Before we study the law of refraction, it is useful to
discuss the speed of light and how it varies between different media.
The speed of light is now known to great precision. In fact, the speed of light in a vacuum, c, is so important, and is so precisely
known, that it is accepted as one of the basic physical quantities, and has the fixed value
16.4
108 m/s is used whenever three-digit precision is sufficient. The speed of light through

where the approximate value of 3.00
matter is less than it is in a vacuum, because light interacts with atoms in a material. The speed of light depends strongly on the
type of material, given that its interaction with different atoms, crystal lattices, and other substructures varies. We define the
index of refraction, n, of a material to be

where v is the observed speed of light in the material. Because the speed of light is always less than c in matter and equals c only
in a vacuum, the index of refraction (plural: indices of refraction) is always greater than or equal to one.

greatest indices of refraction.
Figure 16.17 provides an analogy for and a description of how a ray of light changes direction when it passes from one medium to
another. As in the previous section, the angles are measured relative to a perpendicular to the surface at the point where the
light ray crosses it. The change in direction of the light ray depends on how the speed of light changes. The change in the speed
of light is related to the indices of refraction of the media involved. In the situations shown in Figure 16.17, medium 2 has a
greater index of refraction than medium 1. This difference in index of refraction means that the speed of light is less in medium
2 than in medium 1. Note that, in Figure 16.17(a), the path of the ray moves closer to the perpendicular when the ray slows down.
Conversely, in Figure 16.17(b), the path of the ray moves away from the perpendicular when the ray speeds up. The path is exactly
reversible. In both cases, you can imagine what happens by thinking about pushing a lawn mower from a footpath onto grass,
and vice versa. Going from the footpath to grass, the right front wheel is slowed and pulled to the side as shown. This is the same
change in direction for light when it goes from a fast medium to a slow one. When going from the grass to the footpath, the left
front wheel moves faster than the others, and the mower changes direction as shown. This, too, is the same change in direction
as light going from slow to fast.

Figure 16.17 The change in direction of a light ray depends on how the speed of light changes when it crosses from one medium to another.
For the situations shown here, the speed of light is greater in medium 1 than in medium 2. (a) A ray of light moves closer to the
perpendicular when it slows down. This is analogous to what happens when a lawnmower goes from a footpath (medium 1) to grass
(medium 2). (b) A ray of light moves away from the perpendicular when it speeds up. This is analogous to what happens when a lawnmower
goes from grass (medium 2) to the footpath (medium 1). The paths are exactly reversible.

Bending Light

Click to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/28Bendinglight)
The Bending Light simulation in allows you to show light refracting as it crosses the boundaries between various media
(download animation first to view). It also shows the reflected ray. You can move the protractor to the point where the light
meets the boundary and measure the angle of incidence, the angle of refraction, and the angle of reflection. You can also
insert a prism into the beam to view the spreading, or dispersion, of white light into colors, as discussed later in this
section. Use the ray option at the upper left.
A light ray moving upward strikes a horizontal boundary at an acute angle relative to the perpendicular and enters the
medium above the boundary. What must be true for the light to bend away from the perpendicular?
a. The medium below the boundary must have a greater index of refraction than the medium above.
b. The medium below the boundary must have a lower index of refraction than the medium above.
c. The medium below the boundary must have an index of refraction of zero.
d. The medium above the boundary must have an infinite index of refraction.

The amount that a light ray changes direction depends both on the incident angle and the amount that the speed changes. For a
ray at a given incident angle, a large change in speed causes a large change in direction, and thus a large change in the angle of
refraction. The exact mathematical relationship is the law of refraction, or Snell’s law, which is stated in equation form as

In terms of speeds, Snell’s law becomes
16.5
Here, n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction for media 1 and 2, respectively, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles between the rays and the
perpendicular in the respective media 1 and 2, as shown in Figure 16.17. The incoming ray is called the incident ray and the
outgoing ray is called the refracted ray. The associated angles are called the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. Later,
we apply Snell’s law to some practical situations.
Dispersion is defined as the spreading of white light into the wavelengths of which it is composed. This happens because the
index of refraction varies slightly with wavelength. Figure 16.18 shows how a prism disperses white light into the colors of the
rainbow.

Figure 16.18 (a) A pure wavelength of light (

) falls onto a prism and is refracted at both surfaces. (b) White light is dispersed by the prism

(spread of light exaggerated). Because the index of refraction varies with wavelength, the angles of refraction vary with wavelength. A
sequence of red to violet is produced, because the index of refraction increases steadily with decreasing wavelength.

Rainbows are produced by a combination of refraction and reflection. You may have noticed that you see a rainbow only when
you turn your back to the Sun. Light enters a drop of water and is reflected from the back of the drop, as shown in Figure 16.19.
The light is refracted both as it enters and as it leaves the drop. Because the index of refraction of water varies with wavelength,
the light is dispersed and a rainbow is observed.

Figure 16.19 Part of the light falling on this water drop enters and is reflected from the back of the drop. This light is refracted and
dispersed both as it enters and as it leaves the drop.

16.2 • Refraction

A good-quality mirror reflects more than 90 percent of the light that falls on it; the mirror absorbs the rest. But, it would be
useful to have a mirror that reflects all the light that falls on it. Interestingly, we can produce total reflection using an aspect of
refraction. Consider what happens when a ray of light strikes the surface between two materials, such as is shown in Figure
16.20(a). Part of the light crosses the boundary and is refracted; the rest is reflected. If, as shown in the figure, the index of
refraction for the second medium is less than the first, the ray bends away from the perpendicular. Because n1 > n2, the angle of
refraction is greater than the angle of incidence—that is, > . Now, imagine what happens as the incident angle is
increased. This causes to increase as well. The largest the angle of refraction, , can be is 90°, as shown in Figure 16.20(b).
The critical angle, , for a combination of two materials is defined to be the incident angle, , which produces an angle of
refraction of 90°. That is, is the incident angle for which = 90°. If the incident angle, , is greater than the critical angle,
as shown in Figure 16.20(c), then all the light is reflected back into medium 1, a condition called total internal reflection.

Figure 16.20 (a) A ray of light crosses a boundary where the speed of light increases and the index of refraction decreases—that is, n2 < n1.
The refracted ray bends away from the perpendicular. (b) The critical angle,

, is the one for which the angle of refraction is 90°. (c) Total

internal reflection occurs when the incident angle is greater than the critical angle.

Recall that Snell’s law states the relationship between angles and indices of refraction. It is given by

When the incident angle equals the critical angle (
Snell’s law in this case becomes

493

494

Chapter 16 • Mirrors and Lenses

The critical angle,

, for a given combination of materials is thus

for n1 > n2.
Total internal reflection occurs for any incident angle greater than the critical angle, , and it can only occur when the second
medium has an index of refraction less than the first. Note that the previous equation is written for a light ray that travels in
medium 1 and reflects from medium 2, as shown in Figure 16.20.
There are several important applications of total internal reflection. Total internal reflection, coupled with a large index of
refraction, explains why diamonds sparkle more than other materials. The critical angle for a diamond-to-air surface is only
24.4°; so, when light enters a diamond, it has trouble getting back out (Figure 16.21). Although light freely enters the diamond at
different angles, it can exit only if it makes an angle less than 24.4° with the normal to a given surface. Facets on diamonds are
specifically intended to make this unlikely, so that the light can exit only in certain places. Diamonds with very few impurities
are very clear, so the light makes many internal reflections and is concentrated at the few places it can exit—hence the sparkle.

Figure 16.21 Light cannot escape a diamond easily because its critical angle with air is so small. Most reflections are total and the facets
are placed so that light can exit only in particular ways, thus concentrating the light and making the diamond sparkle.

A light ray that strikes an object that consists of two mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces is reflected back exactly parallel
to the direction from which it came. This parallel reflection is true whenever the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular, and it is
independent of the angle of incidence. Such an object is called a corner reflector because the light bounces from its inside
corner. Many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles, cars, and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to return light in
the direction from which it originates. Corner reflectors are perfectly efficient when the conditions for total internal reflection
are satisfied. With common materials, it is easy to obtain a critical angle that is less than 45°. One use of these perfect mirrors is
in binoculars, as shown in Figure 16.22. Another application is for periscopes used in submarines.

Figure 16.22 These binoculars use corner reflectors with total internal reflection to get light to the observer’s eyes.

Fiber optics are one common application of total internal reflection. In communications, fiber optics are used to transmit
telephone, internet, and cable TV signals, and they use the transmission of light down fibers of plastic or glass. Because the

16.2 • Refraction

fibers are thin, light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and, thus, be
totally reflected (Figure 16.23). The index of refraction outside the fiber must be smaller than inside, a condition that is satisfied
easily by coating the outside of the fiber with a material that has an appropriate refractive index. In fact, most fibers have a
varying refractive index to allow more light to be guided along the fiber through total internal reflection. Rays are reflected
around corners as shown in the figure, making the fibers into tiny light pipes.

Figure 16.23 (a) Fibers in bundles are clad by a material that has a lower index of refraction than the core to ensure total internal reflection,
even when fibers are in contact with one another. A single fiber with its cladding is shown. (b) Light entering a thin fiber may strike the
inside surface at large, or grazing, angles, and is completely reflected if these angles exceed the critical angle. Such rays continue down the
fiber, even following it around corners, because the angles of reflection and incidence remain large.

Figure 16.24 Endoscopes, such as the one drawn here, send light down a flexible fiber optic tube, which sends images back to a doctor in

The word endoscope means looking inside. Doctors use endoscopes to look inside hollow organs in the human body and inside
body cavities. These devices are used to diagnose internal physical problems. Images may be transmitted to an eyepiece or sent
to a video screen. Another channel is sometimes included to allow the use of small surgical instruments. Such surgical

Calculating Index of Refraction from Speed

Calculate the index of refraction for a solid medium in which the speed of light is 2.012 108 m/s, and identify the most likely
substance, based on the previous table of indicies of refraction.
STRATEGY
We know the speed of light, c, is 3.00 108 m/s, and we are given v. We can simply plug these values into the equation for index
of refraction, n.
Solution
16.9
This value matches that of polystyrene exactly, according to the table of indices of refraction (Table 16.2).

The three-digit approximation for c is used, which in this case is all that is needed. Many values in the table are only given to
three significant figures. Note that the units for speed cancel to yield a dimensionless answer, which is correct.

us n for water as 1.333. All we have to do before solving the problem is rearrange the equation

Solution
16.12
The best match from Table 16.2 is fused quartz, with n = 1.458.
Discussion
Note the relative sizes of the variables involved. For example, a larger angle has a larger sine value. This checks out for the two
angles involved. Note that the smaller value of compared with indicates the ray has bent toward normal. This result is to
be expected if the unknown substance has a greater n value than that of water. The result shows that this is the case.

Discussion
Remember, when we try to find a critical angle, we look for the angle at which light can no longer escape past a medium
boundary by refraction. It is logical, then, to think of subscript 1 as referring to the medium the light is trying to leave, and
subscript 2 as where it is trying (unsuccessfully) to go. So water is 1 and air is 2.

Characteristics of Lenses
Lenses are found in a huge array of optical instruments, ranging from a simple magnifying glass to the eye to a camera’s zoom
lens. In this section, we use the law of refraction to explore the properties of lenses and how they form images.
Some of what we learned in the earlier discussion of curved mirrors also applies to the study of lenses. Concave, convex, focal
point F, and focal length f have the same meanings as before, except each measurement is made from the center of the lens
instead of the surface of the mirror. The convex lens shown in Figure 16.25 has been shaped so that all light rays that enter it
parallel to its central axis cross one another at a single point on the opposite side of the lens. The central axis, or axis, is defined
to be a line normal to the lens at its center. Such a lens is called a converging lens because of the converging effect it has on light
rays. An expanded view of the path of one ray through the lens is shown in Figure 16.25 to illustrate how the ray changes

16.3 • Lenses

direction both as it enters and as it leaves the lens. Because the index of refraction of the lens is greater than that of air, the ray
moves toward the perpendicular as it enters and away from the perpendicular as it leaves. (This is in accordance with the law of
refraction.) As a result of the shape of the lens, light is thus bent toward the axis at both surfaces.

Figure 16.25 Rays of light entering a convex, or converging, lens parallel to its axis converge at its focal point, F. Ray 2 lies on the axis of the
lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is the focal length, ƒ, of the lens. An expanded view of the path taken by ray
1 shows the perpendiculars and the angles of incidence and refraction at both surfaces.

Note that rays from a light source placed at the focal point of a converging lens emerge parallel from the other side of the lens.
You may have heard of the trick of using a converging lens to focus rays of sunlight to a point. Such a concentration of light
energy can produce enough heat to ignite paper.
Figure 16.26 shows a concave lens and the effect it has on rays of light that enter it parallel to its axis (the path taken by ray 2 in
the figure is the axis of the lens). The concave lens is a diverging lens because it causes the light rays to bend away (diverge) from
its axis. In this case, the lens has been shaped so all light rays entering it parallel to its axis appear to originate from the same
point, F, defined to be the focal point of a diverging lens. The distance from the center of the lens to the focal point is again called
the focal length, or “ƒ,” of the lens. Note that the focal length of a diverging lens is defined to be negative. An expanded view of
the path of one ray through the lens is shown in Figure 16.26 to illustrate how the shape of the lens, together with the law of
refraction, causes the ray to follow its particular path and diverge.

Figure 16.26 Rays of light enter a concave, or diverging, lens parallel to its axis diverge and thus appear to originate from its focal point, F.
The dashed lines are not rays; they indicate the directions from which the rays appear to come. The focal length, ƒ, of a diverging lens is
negative. An expanded view of the path taken by ray 1 shows the perpendiculars and the angles of incidence and refraction at both
surfaces.

The power, P, of a lens is very easy to calculate. It is simply the reciprocal of the focal length, expressed in meters
16.15
The units of power are diopters, D, which are expressed in reciprocal meters. If the focal length is negative, as it is for the
diverging lens in Figure 16.26, then the power is also negative.
In some circumstances, a lens forms an image at an obvious location, such as when a movie projector casts an image onto a
screen. In other cases, the image location is less obvious. Where, for example, is the image formed by eyeglasses? We use ray

quantitatively. These are the rules for ray tracing:

5.

A ray entering a converging lens parallel to its axis passes through the focal point, F, of the lens on the other side
A ray entering a diverging lens parallel to its axis seems to come from the focal point, F, on the side of the entering ray
A ray passing through the center of either a converging or a diverging lens does not change direction
A ray entering a converging lens through its focal point exits parallel to its axis
A ray that enters a diverging lens by heading toward the focal point on the opposite side exits parallel to the axis

Consider an object some distance away from a converging lens, as shown in Figure 16.27. To find the location and size of the
image formed, we trace the paths of select light rays originating from one point on the object. In this example, the originating
point is the top of a woman’s head. Figure 16.27 shows three rays from the top of the object that can be traced using the raytracing rules just listed. Rays leave this point traveling in many directions, but we concentrate on only a few, which have paths
that are easy to trace. The first ray is one that enters the lens parallel to its axis and passes through the focal point on the other
side (rule 1). The second ray passes through the center of the lens without changing direction (rule 3). The third ray passes
through the nearer focal point on its way into the lens and leaves the lens parallel to its axis (rule 4). All rays that come from the
same point on the top of the person’s head are refracted in such a way as to cross at the same point on the other side of the lens.
The image of the top of the person’s head is located at this point. Rays from another point on the object, such as the belt buckle,
also cross at another common point, forming a complete image, as shown. Although three rays are traced in Figure 16.27, only
two are necessary to locate the image. It is best to trace rays for which there are simple ray-tracing rules. Before applying ray
tracing to other situations, let us consider the example shown in Figure 16.27 in more detail.

16.3 • Lenses

Figure 16.27 Ray tracing is used to locate the image formed by a lens. Rays originating from the same point on the object are traced. The
three chosen rays each follow one of the rules for ray tracing, so their paths are easy to determine. The image is located at the point where
the rays cross. In this case, a real image—one that can be projected on a screen—is formed.

The image formed in Figure 16.27 is a real image—meaning, it can be projected. That is, light rays from one point on the object
actually cross at the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen, a piece of film, or the retina of an eye.
In Figure 16.27, the object distance, do, is greater than f. Now we consider a ray diagram for a convex lens where do< f, and
another diagram for a concave lens.

Some common applications of lenses with which we are all familiar are magnifying glasses, eyeglasses, cameras, microscopes,
and telescopes. We take a look at the latter two examples, which are the most complex. We have already seen the design of a
telescope that uses only mirrors in . Figure 16.29 shows the design of a telescope that uses two lenses. Part (a) of the figure shows
the design of the telescope used by Galileo. It produces an upright image, which is more convenient for many applications. Part

of a problem when viewing celestial objects.

Figure 16.29 (a) Galileo made telescopes with a convex objective and a concave eyepiece. They produce an upright image and are used in
spyglasses. (b) Most simple telescopes have two convex lenses. The objective forms a case 1 image, which is the object for the eyepiece.
The eyepiece forms a case 2 final image that is magnified.

Figure 16.30 shows the path of light through a typical microscope. Microscopes were first developed during the early 1600s by
eyeglass makers in the Netherlands and Denmark. The simplest compound microscope is constructed from two convex lenses,
as shown schematically in Figure 16.30. The first lens is called the objective lens; it has typical magnification values from 5 to
100 . In standard microscopes, the objectives are mounted such that when you switch between them, the sample remains in
focus. Objectives arranged in this way are described as parfocal. The second lens, the eyepiece, also referred to as the ocular,
has several lenses that slide inside a cylindrical barrel. The focusing ability is provided by the movement of both the objective
lens and the eyepiece. The purpose of a microscope is to magnify small objects, and both lenses contribute to the final
magnification. In addition, the final enlarged image is produced in a location far enough from the observer to be viewed easily
because the eye cannot focus on objects or images that are too close.

Figure 16.30 A compound microscope composed of two lenses, an objective and an eyepiece. The objective forms a case 1 image that is
larger than the object. This first image is the object for the eyepiece. The eyepiece forms a case 2 final image that is magnified even further.

Real lenses behave somewhat differently from how they are modeled using rays diagrams or the thin-lens equations. Real lenses
produce aberrations. An aberration is a distortion in an image. There are a variety of aberrations that result from lens size,
material, thickness, and the position of the object. One common type of aberration is chromatic aberration, which is related to
color. Because the index of refraction of lenses depends on color, or wavelength, images are produced at different places and
with different magnifications for different colors. The law of reflection is independent of wavelength, so mirrors do not have this
problem. This result is another advantage for the use of mirrors in optical systems such as telescopes.
Figure 16.31(a) shows chromatic aberration for a single convex lens, and its partial correction with a two-lens system. The index
of refraction of the lens increases with decreasing wavelength, so violet rays are refracted more than red rays, and are thus
focused closer to the lens. The diverging lens corrects this in part, although it is usually not possible to do so completely. Lenses
made of different materials and with different dispersions may be used. For example, an achromatic doublet consisting of a
converging lens made of crown glass in contact with a diverging lens made of flint glass can reduce chromatic aberration
dramatically (Figure 16.31(b)).

Figure 16.31 (a) Chromatic aberration is caused by the dependence of a lens’s index of refraction on color (wavelength). The lens is more
powerful for violet (V) than for red (R), producing images with different colors, locations, and magnifications. (b) Multiple-lens systems can
correct chromatic aberrations in part, but they may require lenses of different materials and add to the expense of optical systems such as
cameras.

Physics of the Eye
The eye is perhaps the most interesting of all optical instruments. It is remarkable in how it forms images and in the richness of
detail and color they eye can detect. However, our eyes commonly need some correction to reach what is called normal vision,
but should be called ideal vision instead. Image formation by our eyes and common vision correction are easy to analyze using
geometric optics. Figure 16.32 shows the basic anatomy of the eye. The cornea and lens form a system that, to a good
approximation, acts as a single thin lens. For clear vision, a real image must be projected onto the light-sensitive retina, which
lies at a fixed distance from the lens. The lens of the eye adjusts its power to produce an image on the retina for objects at
different distances. The center of the image falls on the fovea, which has the greatest density of light receptors and the greatest
acuity (sharpness) in the visual field. There are no receptors at the place where the optic nerve meets the eye, which is called the
blind spot. An image falling on this spot cannot be seen. The variable opening (or pupil) of the eye along with chemical
adaptation allows the eye to detect light intensities from the lowest observable to 1010 times greater (without damage). Ten
orders of magnitude is an incredible range of detection. Our eyes perform a vast number of functions, such as sense direction,
movement, sophisticated colors, and distance. Processing of visual nerve impulses begins with interconnections in the retina
and continues in the brain. The optic nerve conveys signals received by the eye to the brain.

Figure 16.32 The cornea and lens of an eye act together to form a real image on the light-sensing retina, which has its densest
concentration of receptors in the fovea, and a blind spot over the optic nerve. The power of the lens of an eye is adjustable to provide an
image on the retina for varying object distances.

Refractive indices are crucial to image formation using lenses. Table 16.4 shows refractive indices relevant to the eye. The biggest
change in the refractive index—and the one that causes the greatest bending of rays—occurs at the cornea rather than the lens.
The ray diagram in Figure 16.33 shows image formation by the cornea and lens of the eye. The rays bend according to the
refractive indices provided in Table 16.4. The cornea provides about two-thirds of the magnification of the eye because the speed
of light changes considerably while traveling from air into the cornea. The lens provides the remaining magnification needed to
produce an image on the retina. The cornea and lens can be treated as a single thin lens, although the light rays pass through
several layers of material (such as the cornea, aqueous humor, several layers in the lens, and vitreous humor), changing direction
at each interface. The image formed is much like the one produced by a single convex lens. This result is a case 1 image. Images
formed in the eye are inverted, but the brain inverts them once more to make them seem upright.

Table 16.4 Refractive Indices Relevant to the Eye

Figure 16.33 An image is formed on the retina, with light rays converging most at the cornea and on entering and exiting the lens. Rays from
the top and bottom of the object are traced and produce an inverted real image on the retina. The distance to the object is drawn smaller
than scale.

As noted, the image must fall precisely on the retina to produce clear vision—that is, the image distance, di, must equal the lensto-retina distance. Because the lens-to-retina distance does not change, di must be the same for objects at all distances. The eye
manages to vary the distance by varying the power (and focal length) of the lens to accommodate for objects at various distances.
In Figure 16.33, you can see the small ciliary muscles above and below the lens that change the shape of the lens and, thus, the
focal length.
The need for some type of vision correction is very common. Common vision defects are easy to understand, and some are
simple to correct. Figure 16.34 illustrates two common vision defects. Nearsightedness, or myopia, is the inability to see distant
objects clearly while close objects are in focus. The nearsighted eye overconverges the nearly parallel rays from a distant object,
and the rays cross in front of the retina. More divergent rays from a close object are converged on the retina, producing a clear
image. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the inability to see close objects clearly whereas distant objects may be in focus. A
farsighted eye does not converge rays from a close object sufficiently to make the rays meet on the retina. Less divergent rays
from a distant object can be converged for a clear image.

Figure 16.34 (a) The nearsighted (myopic) eye converges rays from a distant object in front of the retina; thus, they are diverging when they
strike the retina, and produce a blurry image. This divergence can be caused by the lens of the eye being too powerful (in other words, too
short a focal length) or the length of the eye being too great. (b) The farsighted (hyperopic) eye is unable to converge the rays from a close
object by the time they strike the retina and produce ... blurry close vision. This poor convergence can be caused by insufficient power (in

507

508

Chapter 16 • Mirrors and Lenses

other words, too long a focal length) in the lens or by the eye being too short.

Because the nearsighted eye overconverges light rays, the correction for nearsightedness involves placing a diverging spectacle
lens in front of the eye. This lens reduces the power of an eye that has too short a focal length (Figure 16.35(a)). Because the
farsighted eye underconverges light rays, the correction for farsightedness is to place a converging spectacle lens in front of the
eye. This lens increases the power of an eye that has too long a focal length (Figure 16.35(b)).

Figure 16.35 (a) Correction of nearsightedness requires a diverging lens that compensates for the overconvergence by the eye. The
diverging lens produces an image closer to the eye than the object so that the nearsighted person can see it clearly. (b) Correction of
farsightedness uses a converging lens that compensates for the underconvergence by the eye. The converging lens produces an image
farther from the eye than the object so that the farsighted person can see it clearly. In both (a) and (b), the rays that meet at the retina
represent corrected vision, and the other rays represent blurred vision without corrective lenses.

Calculations Using Lens Equations
As promised, there are no new equations to memorize. We can use equations already presented for solving problems involving
curved mirrors. Careful analysis allows you to apply these equations to lenses. Here are the equations you need

where P is power, expressed in reciprocal meters (m–1) rather than diopters (D), and f is focal length, expressed in meters (m).
You also need

where, as before, do and di are object distance and image distance, respectively. Remember, this equation is usually more useful
if rearranged to solve for one of the variables. For example,

The equations for magnification, m, are also the same as for mirrors

where hi and ho are the image height and object height, respectively. Remember, also, that a negative di value indicates a virtual
image and a negative hi value indicates an inverted image.
These are the steps to follow when solving a lens problem:
• Step 1. Examine the situation to determine that image formation by a lens is involved.
• Step 2. Determine whether ray tracing, the thin-lens equations, or both should be used. A sketch is very helpful even if ray
tracing is not specifically required by the problem. Write useful symbols and values on the sketch.
• Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns).
• Step 4. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). It is helpful to
determine whether the situation involves a case 1, 2, or 3 image. Although these are just names for types of images, they
have certain characteristics (given in Table 16.3) that can be of great use in solving problems.

16.3 • Lenses

• Step 5. If ray tracing is required, use the ray-tracing rules listed earlier in this section.
• Step 6. Most quantitative problems require the use of the thin-lens equations. These equations are solved in the usual
manner by substituting knowns and solving for unknowns. Several worked examples were included earlier and can serve as
guides.
• Step 7. Check whether the answer is reasonable. Does it make sense? If you identified the type of image (case 1, 2, or 3)
correctly, you should assess whether your answer is consistent with the type of image, magnification, and so on.
All problems will be solved by one or more of the equations just presented, with ray tracing used only for general analysis of the
problem. The steps then simplify to the following:
1. Identify the unknown.
2. Identify the knowns.
3. Choose an equation, plug in the knowns, and solve for the unknown.
Here are some worked examples:

WORKED EXAMPLE
The Power of a Magnifying Glass
Strategy
The Sun is so far away that its rays are nearly parallel when they reach Earth. The magnifying glass is a convex (or converging)
lens, focusing the nearly parallel rays of sunlight. Thus, the focal length of the lens is the distance from the lens to the spot, and
its power, in diopters (D), is the inverse of this distance (in reciprocal meters).
Solution
The focal length of the lens is the distance from the center of the lens to the spot, which we know to be 8.00 cm. Thus,
16.16
To find the power of the lens, we must first convert the focal length to meters; then, we substitute this value into the equation for
power.
16.17
Discussion
This result demonstrates a relatively powerful lens. Remember that the power of a lens in diopters should not be confused with
the familiar concept of power in watts.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Image Formation by a Convex Lens

A clear glass light bulb is placed 0.75 m from a convex lens with a 0.50 m focal length, as shown in Figure 16.36. Use ray tracing to
get an approximate location for the image. Then, use the mirror/lens equations to calculate (a) the location of the image and (b)
its magnification. Verify that ray tracing and the thin-lens and magnification equations produce consistent results.

Figure 16.36

A light bulb placed 0.75 m from a lens with a 0.50 m focal length produces a real image on a poster board, as discussed in

the previous example. Ray tracing predicts the image location and size.

509

510

Chapter 16 • Mirrors and Lenses

Strategy
Because the object is placed farther away from a converging lens than the focal length of the lens, this situation is analogous to
the one illustrated in the previous figure of a series of drawings showing a woman standing to the left of a lens. Ray tracing to
scale should produce similar results for di. Numerical solutions for di and m can be obtained using the thin-lens and
magnification equations, noting that do = 0.75 m and f = 0.50 m.
Solution
The ray tracing to scale in Figure 16.36 shows two rays from a point on the bulb’s filament crossing about 1.50 m on the far side of
the lens. Thus, the image distance, di, is about 1.50 m. Similarly, the image height based on ray tracing is greater than the object
height by about a factor of two, and the image is inverted. Thus, m is about –2. The minus sign indicates the image is inverted.
The lens equation can be rearranged to solve for di from the given information.
16.18
Now, we use

to find m.
16.19

Discussion
Note that the minus sign causes the magnification to be negative when the image is inverted. Ray tracing and the use of the lens
equation produce consistent results. The thin-lens equation gives the most precise results, and is limited only by the accuracy of
the given information. Ray tracing is limited by the accuracy with which you draw, but it is highly useful both conceptually and
visually.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Image Formation by a Concave Lens

Suppose an object, such as a book page, is held 6.50 cm from a concave lens with a focal length of –10.0 cm. Such a lens could be
used in eyeglasses to correct pronounced nearsightedness. What magnification is produced?
Strategy
This example is identical to the preceding one, except that the focal length is negative for a concave or diverging lens. The
method of solution is therefore the same, but the results are different in important ways.
Solution
16.20
Now the magnification equation can be used to find the magnification, m, because both di and do are known. Entering their
values gives
16.21
Discussion
A number of results in this example are true of all case 3 images. Magnification is positive (as calculated), meaning the image is
upright. The magnification is also less than one, meaning the image is smaller than the object—in this case, a little more than
half its size. The image distance is negative, meaning the image is on the same side of the lens as the object. The image is virtual.
The image is closer to the lens than the object, because the image distance is smaller in magnitude than the object distance. The
location of the image is not obvious when you look through a concave lens. In fact, because the image is smaller than the object,
you may think it is farther away; however, the image is closer than the object—a fact that is useful in correcting nearsightedness.

INTRODUCTION Examine a compact disc under white light, noting the colors observed and their locations on the disc. Using
the CD, explore the spectra of a few light sources, such as a candle flame, an incandescent bulb, and fluorescent light. If you have
ever looked at the reds, blues, and greens in a sunlit soap bubble and wondered how straw-colored soapy water could produce
them, you have hit upon one of the many phenomena that can only be explained by the wave character of light. That and other
interesting phenomena, such as the dispersion of white light into a rainbow of colors when passed through a narrow slit, cannot
be explained fully by geometric optics. In such cases, light interacts with small objects and exhibits its wave characteristics. The
topic of this chapter is the branch of optics that considers the behavior of light when it exhibits wave characteristics.

Chapter 17 • Diffraction and Interference

Diffraction and Interference
We know that visible light is the type of electromagnetic wave to which our eyes responds. As we have seen previously, light
obeys the equation
where
m/s is the speed of light in vacuum, f is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave in Hz (or s–1), and
is its wavelength in m. The range of visible wavelengths is approximately 380 to 750 nm. As is true for all waves, light travels in
straight lines and acts like a ray when it interacts with objects several times as large as its wavelength. However, when it
interacts with smaller objects, it displays its wave characteristics prominently. Interference is the identifying behavior of a wave.
In Figure 17.2, both the ray and wave characteristics of light can be seen. The laser beam emitted by the observatory represents
ray behavior, as it travels in a straight line. Passing a pure, one-wavelength beam through vertical slits with a width close to the
wavelength of the beam reveals the wave character of light. Here we see the beam spreading out horizontally into a pattern of
bright and dark regions that are caused by systematic constructive and destructive interference. As it is characteristic of wave
behavior, interference is observed for water waves, sound waves, and light waves.

Figure 17.2 (a) The light beam emitted by a laser at the Paranal Observatory (part of the European Southern Observatory in Chile) acts like
a ray, traveling in a straight line. (credit: Yuri Beletsky, European Southern Observatory) (b) A laser beam passing through a grid of vertical
slits produces an interference pattern—characteristic of a wave. (credit: Shim’on and Slava Rybka, Wikimedia Commons)

That interference is a characteristic of energy propagation by waves is demonstrated more convincingly by water waves. Figure
17.3 shows water waves passing through gaps between some rocks. You can easily see that the gaps are similar in width to the
wavelength of the waves and that this causes an interference pattern as the waves pass beyond the gaps. A cross-section across
the waves in the foreground would show the crests and troughs characteristic of an interference pattern.

Figure 17.3 Incoming waves (at the top of the picture) pass through the gaps in the rocks and create an interference pattern (in the
foreground).

Light has wave characteristics in various media as well as in a vacuum. When light goes from a vacuum to some medium, such
as water, its speed and wavelength change, but its frequency, f, remains the same. The speed of light in a medium is
,
where n is its index of refraction. If you divide both sides of the equation
by n, you get

17.1 • Understanding Diffraction and Interference

where is the wavelength in vacuum and n is the medium’s index of refraction. It follows that the wavelength of light is smaller
in any medium than it is in vacuum. In water, for example, which has n = 1.333, the range of visible wavelengths is (380 nm)/1.333
to (760 nm)/1.333, or
285–570 nm. Although wavelengths change while traveling from one medium to another, colors do
not, since colors are associated with frequency.
The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) developed a useful technique for determining in detail how and where
waves propagate. He used wavefronts, which are the points on a wave’s surface that share the same, constant phase (such as all
the points that make up the crest of a water wave). Huygens’s principle states, “Every point on a wavefront is a source of
wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wavefront is a line tangent to all
of the wavelets.”
Figure 17.4 shows how Huygens’s principle is applied. A wavefront is the long edge that moves; for example, the crest or the
trough. Each point on the wavefront emits a semicircular wave that moves at the propagation speed v. These are drawn later at a
time, t, so that they have moved a distance
. The new wavefront is a line tangent to the wavelets and is where the wave is
located at time t. Huygens’s principle works for all types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, and light waves. It will
be useful not only in describing how light waves propagate, but also in how they interfere.

Figure 17.4 Huygens’s principle applied to a straight wavefront. Each point on the wavefront emits a semicircular wavelet that moves a
distance

. The new wavefront is a line tangent to the wavelets.

What happens when a wave passes through an opening, such as light shining through an open door into a dark room? For light,
you expect to see a sharp shadow of the doorway on the floor of the room, and you expect no light to bend around corners into
other parts of the room. When sound passes through a door, you hear it everywhere in the room and, thus, you understand that
sound spreads out when passing through such an opening. What is the difference between the behavior of sound waves and
light waves in this case? The answer is that the wavelengths that make up the light are very short, so that the light acts like a ray.
Sound has wavelengths on the order of the size of the door, and so it bends around corners.
If light passes through smaller openings, often called slits, you can use Huygens’s principle to show that light bends as sound
does (see Figure 17.5). The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called diffraction. Diffraction is a

525

526

Chapter 17 • Diffraction and Interference

wave characteristic that occurs for all types of waves. If diffraction is observed for a phenomenon, it is evidence that the
phenomenon is produced by waves. Thus, the horizontal diffraction of the laser beam after it passes through slits in Figure 17.2
is evidence that light has the properties of a wave.

Figure 17.5 Huygens’s principle applied to a straight wavefront striking an opening. The edges of the wavefront bend after passing through
the opening, a process called diffraction. The amount of bending is more extreme for a small opening, consistent with the fact that wave
characteristics are most noticeable for interactions with objects about the same size as the wavelength.

Once again, water waves present a familiar example of a wave phenomenon that is easy to observe and understand, as shown in
Figure 17.6.

Figure 17.6 Ocean waves pass through an opening in a reef, resulting in a diffraction pattern. Diffraction occurs because the opening is
similar in width to the wavelength of the waves.

The fact that Huygens’s principle worked was not considered enough evidence to prove that light is a wave. People were also
reluctant to accept light’s wave nature because it contradicted the ideas of Isaac Newton, who was still held in high esteem. The
acceptance of the wave character of light came after 1801, when the English physicist and physician Thomas Young (1773–1829)
did his now-classic double-slit experiment (see Figure 17.7).

17.1 • Understanding Diffraction and Interference

Figure 17.7 Young’s double-slit experiment. Here, light of a single wavelength passes through a pair of vertical slits and produces a
diffraction pattern on the screen—numerous vertical light and dark lines that are spread out horizontally. Without diffraction and
interference, the light would simply make two lines on the screen.

When light passes through narrow slits, it is diffracted into semicircular waves, as shown in Figure 17.8 (a). Pure constructive
interference occurs where the waves line up crest to crest or trough to trough. Pure destructive interference occurs where they
line up crest to trough. The light must fall on a screen and be scattered into our eyes for the pattern to be visible. An analogous
pattern for water waves is shown in Figure 17.8 (b). Note that regions of constructive and destructive interference move out from
the slits at well-defined angles to the original beam. Those angles depend on wavelength and the distance between the slits, as
you will see below.

Figure 17.8 Double slits produce two sources of waves that interfere. (a) Light spreads out (diffracts) from each slit, because the slits are
narrow. The waves overlap and interfere constructively (bright lines) and destructively (dark regions). You can only see the effect if the light
falls onto a screen and is scattered into your eyes. (b) The double-slit interference pattern for water waves is nearly identical to that for
light. Wave action is greatest in regions of constructive interference and least in regions of destructive interference. (c) When light that has
passed through double slits falls on a screen, we see a pattern such as this.

Calculations Involving Diffraction and Interference
The fact that the wavelength of light of one color, or monochromatic light, can be calculated from its two-slit diffraction pattern
in Young’s experiments supports the conclusion that light has wave properties. To understand the basis of such calculations,
consider how two waves travel from the slits to the screen. Each slit is a different distance from a given point on the screen. Thus
different numbers of wavelengths fit into each path. Waves start out from the slits in phase (crest to crest), but they will end up
out of phase (crest to trough) at the screen if the paths differ in length by half a wavelength, interfering destructively. If the paths
differ by a whole wavelength, then the waves arrive in phase (crest to crest) at the screen, interfering constructively. More
, then
generally, if the paths taken by the two waves differ by any half-integral number of wavelengths
destructive interference occurs. Similarly, if the paths taken by the two waves differ by any integral number of wavelengths
, then constructive interference occurs.
Figure 17.9 shows how to determine the path-length difference for waves traveling from two slits to a common point on a screen.
If the screen is a large distance away compared with the distance between the slits, then the angle between the path and a line
from the slits perpendicular to the screen (see the figure) is nearly the same for each path. That approximation and simple

Figure 17.10 The interference pattern for a double slit has an intensity that falls off with angle. The photograph shows multiple bright and
dark lines, or fringes, formed by light passing through a double slit.

Light passing through a single slit forms a diffraction pattern somewhat different from that formed by double slits. Figure 17.11
shows a single-slit diffraction pattern. Note that the central maximum is larger than those on either side, and that the intensity
decreases rapidly on either side.

smaller and dimmer maxima on either side. The central maximum is six times higher than shown. (b) The drawing shows the bright central
maximum and dimmer and thinner maxima on either side. (c) The location of the minima are shown in terms of

The analysis of single-slit diffraction is illustrated in Figure 17.12. Assuming the screen is very far away compared with the size of
the slit, rays heading toward a common destination are nearly parallel. That approximation allows a series of trigonometric
operations that result in the equations for the minima produced by destructive interference.
or

When rays travel straight ahead, they remain in phase and a central maximum is obtained. However, when rays travel at an
angle relative to the original direction of the beam, each ray travels a different distance to the screen, and they can arrive in or
out of phase. Thus, a ray from the center travels a distance
farther than the ray from the top edge of the slit, they arrive out
of phase, and they interfere destructively. Similarly, for every ray between the top and the center of the slit, there is a ray
between the center and the bottom of the slit that travels a distance
farther to the common point on the screen, and so
interferes destructively. Symmetrically, there will be another minimum at the same angle below the direct ray.

To three digits, 633 nm is the wavelength of light emitted by the common He-Ne laser. Not by coincidence, this red color is
similar to that emitted by neon lights. More important, however, is the fact that interference patterns can be used to measure
wavelength. Young did that for visible wavelengths. His analytical technique is still widely used to measure electromagnetic
spectra. For a given order, the angle for constructive interference increases with , so spectra (measurements of intensity versus
wavelength) can be obtained.

Wave-Based Applications of Light
In 1917, Albert Einstein was thinking about photons and excited atoms. He considered an atom excited by a certain amount of
energy and what would happen if that atom were hit by a photon with the same amount of energy. He suggested that the atom
would emit a photon with that amount of energy, and it would be accompanied by the original photon. The exciting part is that
you would have two photons with the same energy and they would be in phase. Those photons could go on to hit other excited
atoms, and soon you would have a stream of in-phase photons. Such a light stream is said to be coherent. Some four decades
later, Einstein’s idea found application in a process called, light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Take the first
letters of all the words (except by and “of”) and write them in order. You get the word laser (see (a)), which is the name of the
device that produces such a beam of light.
Laser beams are directional, very intense, and narrow (only about 0.5 mm in diameter). These properties lead to a number of
applications in industry and medicine. The following are just a few examples:
• This chapter began with a picture of a compact disc (see ). Those audio and data-storage devices began replacing cassette
tapes during the 1990s. CDs are read by interpreting variations in reflections of a laser beam from the surface.
• Some barcode scanners use a laser beam.
• Lasers are used in industry to cut steel and other metals.
• Lasers are bounced off reflectors that astronauts left on the Moon. The time it takes for the light to make the round trip can
be used to make precise calculations of the Earth-Moon distance.
• Laser beams are used to produce holograms. The name hologram means entire picture (from the Greek holo-, as in

holistic), because the image is three-dimensional. A viewer can move around the image and see it from different
perspectives. Holograms take advantage of the wave properties of light, as opposed to traditional photography which is
based on geometric optics. A holographic image is produced by constructive and destructive interference of a split laser
beam.
• One of the advantages of using a laser as a surgical tool is that it is accompanied by very little bleeding.
• Laser eye surgery has improved the vision of many people, without the need for corrective lenses. A laser beam is used to
change the shape of the lens of the eye, thus changing its focal length.

An interesting thing happens if you pass light through a large number of evenly-spaced parallel slits. Such an arrangement of
slits is called a diffraction grating. An interference pattern is created that is very similar to the one formed by double-slit
diffraction (see and ). A diffraction grating can be manufactured by scratching glass with a sharp tool to form a number of
precisely positioned parallel lines, which act like slits. Diffraction gratings work both for transmission of light, as in Figure 17.13,
and for reflection of light, as on the butterfly wings or the Australian opal shown in Figure 17.14, or the CD pictured in the
opening illustration of this chapter. In addition to their use as novelty items, diffraction gratings are commonly used for
spectroscopic dispersion and analysis of light. What makes them particularly useful is the fact that they form a sharper pattern
than do double slits. That is, their bright regions are narrower and brighter, while their dark regions are darker. Figure 17.15
shows idealized graphs demonstrating the sharper pattern. Natural diffraction gratings occur in the feathers of certain birds.
Tiny, fingerlike structures in regular patterns act as reflection gratings, producing constructive interference that gives the
feathers colors not solely due to their pigmentation. The effect is called iridescence.

diffracted in a pattern similar to a double slit, with bright regions at various angles. (b) The pattern obtained for white light incident on a

FUN IN PHYSICS
CD Players

Can you see the grooves on a CD or DVD (see Figure 17.16)? You may think you can because you know they are there, but they are
extremely narrow—1,600 in a millimeter. Because the width of the grooves is similar to wavelengths of visible light, they form a
diffraction grating. That is why you see rainbows on a CD. The colors are attractive, but they are incidental to the functions of
storing and retrieving audio and other data.

Figure 17.16 For its size, this CD holds a surprising amount of information. Likewise, the CD player it is in houses a surprising number of
electronic devices.

The grooves are actually one continuous groove that spirals outward from the center. Data are recorded in the grooves as binary
code (zeroes and ones) in small pits. Information in the pits is detected by a laser that tracks along the groove. It gets even more
complicated: The speed of rotation must be varied as the laser tracks toward the circumference so that the linear speed along the
groove remains constant. There is also an error correction mechanism to prevent the laser beam from getting off track. A
diffraction grating is used to create the first two maxima on either side of the track. If those maxima are not the same distance
from the track, an error is indicated and then corrected.
The pits are reflective because they have been coated with a thin layer of aluminum. That allows the laser beam to be reflected
back and directed toward a photodiode detector. The signal can then be processed and converted to the audio we hear.

Biology: DIC Microscopy

If you were completely transparent, it would be hard to recognize you from your photograph. The same problem arises when
using a traditional microscope to view or photograph small transparent objects such as cells and microbes. Microscopes using
differential interference contrast (DIC) solve the problem by making it possible to view microscopic objects with enhanced
contrast, as shown in Figure 17.17.

Chapter 17 • Diffraction and Interference

Figure 17.17 This aquatic organism was photographed with a DIC microscope. (credit: Public Library of Science)

A DIC microscope separates a polarized light source into two beams polarized at right angles to each other and coherent with
each other, that is, in phase. After passing through the sample, the beams are recombined and realigned so they have the same
plane of polarization. They then create an interference pattern caused by the differences in their optical path and the refractive
indices of the parts of the sample they passed through. The result is an image with contrast and shadowing that could not be
observed with traditional optics.
Where are diffraction gratings used? Diffraction gratings are key components of monochromators—devices that separate the
various wavelengths of incoming light and allow a beam with only a specific wavelength to pass through. Monochromators are
used, for example, in optical imaging of particular wavelengths from biological or medical samples. A diffraction grating can be
chosen to specifically analyze a wavelength of light emitted by molecules in diseased cells in a biopsy sample, or to help excite
strategic molecules in the sample with a selected frequency of light. Another important use is in optical fiber technologies where
fibers are designed to provide optimum performance at specific wavelengths. A range of diffraction gratings is available for
selecting specific wavelengths for such use.
Diffraction gratings are used in spectroscopes to separate a light source into its component wavelengths. When a material is
heated to incandescence, it gives off wavelengths of light characteristic of the chemical makeup of the material. A pure
substance will produce a spectrum that is unique, thus allowing identification of the substance. Spectroscopes are also used to
measure wavelengths both shorter and longer than visible light. Such instruments have become especially useful to astronomers
and chemists. Figure 17.18 shows a diagram of a spectroscope.

Figure 17.18 The diagram shows the function of a diffraction grating in a spectroscope.

Light diffracts as it moves through space, bending around obstacles and interfering constructively and destructively. While
diffraction allows light to be used as a spectroscopic tool, it also limits the detail we can obtain in images.
Figure 17.19 (a) shows the effect of passing light through a small circular aperture. Instead of a bright spot with sharp edges, a
spot with a fuzzy edge surrounded by circles of light is obtained. This pattern is caused by diffraction similar to that produced by
a single slit. Light from different parts of the circular aperture interferes constructively and destructively. The effect is most
noticeable when the aperture is small, but the effect is there for large apertures, too.

Figure 17.19 (a) Monochromatic light passed through a small circular aperture produces this diffraction pattern. (b) Two point light sources
that are close to one another produce overlapping images because of diffraction. (c) If they are closer together, they cannot be resolved,
that is, distinguished.

How does diffraction affect the detail that can be observed when light passes through an aperture? Figure 17.19 (b) shows the
diffraction pattern produced by two point light sources that are close to one another. The pattern is similar to that for a single
point source, and it is just barely possible to tell that there are two light sources rather than one. If they are closer together, as in
Figure 17.19 (c), you cannot distinguish them, thus limiting the detail, or resolution, you can obtain. That limit is an inescapable
consequence of the wave nature of light.
There are many situations in which diffraction limits the resolution. The acuity of vision is limited because light passes through
the pupil, the circular aperture of the eye. Be aware that the diffraction-like spreading of light is due to the limited diameter of a
light beam, not the interaction with an aperture. Thus light passing through a lens with a diameter of D shows the diffraction
effect and spreads, blurring the image, just as light passing through an aperture of diameter D does. Diffraction limits the
resolution of any system having a lens or mirror. Telescopes are also limited by diffraction, because of the finite diameter, D, of
their primary mirror.
Why are diffraction gratings used in spectroscopes rather than just two slits?
a. The bands produced by diffraction gratings are dimmer but sharper than the bands produced by two slits.
b. The bands produced by diffraction gratings are brighter, though less sharp, than the bands produced by two slits.
c. The bands produced by diffraction gratings are brighter and sharper than the bands produced by two slits.
d. The bands produced by diffraction gratings are dimmer and less sharp, but more widely dispersed, than the bands
produced by two slits.

Calculations Involving Diffraction Gratings and Resolution
Early in the chapter, it was mentioned that when light passes from one medium to another, its speed and wavelength change,
but its frequency remains constant. The equation

shows how to the wavelength in a given medium, , is related to the wavelength in a vacuum, , and the refractive index, n, of
the medium. The equation is useful for calculating the change in wavelength of a monochromatic laser beam in various media.
The analysis of a diffraction grating is very similar to that for a double slit. As you know from the discussion of double slits in
Young’s double-slit experiment, light is diffracted by, and spreads out after passing through, each slit. Rays travel at an angle
relative to the incident direction. Each ray travels a different distance to a common point on a screen far away. The rays start in
phase, and they can be in or out of phase when they reach a screen, depending on the difference in the path lengths traveled.
Each ray travels a distance that differs by
from that of its neighbor, where d is the distance between slits. If
equals an integral number of wavelengths, the rays all arrive in phase, and constructive interference (a maximum) is obtained.
Thus, the condition necessary to obtain constructive interference for a diffraction grating is

where d is the distance between slits in the grating, is the wavelength of the light, and m is the order of the maximum. Note
that this is exactly the same equation as for two slits separated by d. However, the slits are usually closer in diffraction gratings
than in double slits, producing fewer maxima at larger angles.

. Why does that

Just what is the resolution limit of an aperture or lens? To answer that question, consider the diffraction pattern for a circular
aperture, which, similar to the diffraction pattern of light passing through a slit, has a central maximum that is wider and
brighter than the maxima surrounding it (see Figure 17.19 (a)). It can be shown that, for a circular aperture of diameter D, the
first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at
, provided that the aperture is large compared with the
wavelength of light, which is the case for most optical instruments. The accepted criterion for determining the diffraction limit
to resolution based on diffraction was developed by Lord Rayleigh in the 19th century. The Rayleigh criterion for the diffraction
limit to resolution states that two images are just resolvable when the center of the diffraction pattern of one is directly over the

etc., with which the two objects are observed. In the expression above, has units of radians.

Static Electricity

causes it to stand on end. The sliding motion stripped electrons away from the child’s body, leaving him with an

INTRODUCTION You may have been introduced to static electricity like the child sliding down the slide in the opening
photograph (Figure 18.1). The zap that he is likely to receive if he touches a playmate or parent tends to bring home the lesson.
But static electricity is more than just fun and games—it is put to use in many industries. The forces between electrically
charged particles are used in technologies such as printers, pollution filters, and spray guns used for painting cars and trucks.
Static electricity is the study of phenomena that involve an imbalance of electrical charge. Although creating this imbalance
typically requires moving charge around, once the imbalance is created, it often remains static for a long time. The study of
charge in motion is called electromagnetism and will be covered in a later chapter. What is electrical charge, how is it associated

Electric Charge
You may know someone who has an electric personality, which usually means that other people are attracted to this person. This
saying is based on electric charge, which is a property of matter that causes objects to attract or repel each other. Electric charge
comes in two varieties, which we call positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, and unlike charges attract each other.
Thus, two positive charges repel each other, as do two negative charges. A positive charge and a negative charge attract each
other.
How do we know there are two types of electric charge? When various materials are rubbed together in controlled ways, certain
combinations of materials always result in a net charge of one type on one material and a net charge of the opposite type on the
other material. By convention, we call one type of charge positive and the other type negative. For example, when glass is rubbed
with silk, the glass becomes positively charged and the silk negatively charged. Because the glass and silk have opposite charges,
they attract one another like clothes that have rubbed together in a dryer. Two glass rods rubbed with silk in this manner will
repel one another, because each rod has positive charge on it. Similarly, two silk cloths rubbed in this manner will repel each
other, because both cloths have negative charge. Figure 18.2 shows how these simple materials can be used to explore the nature
of the force between charges.

Figure 18.2 A glass rod becomes positively charged when rubbed with silk, whereas the silk becomes negatively charged. (a) The glass rod
is attracted to the silk, because their charges are opposite. (b) Two similarly charged glass rods repel. (c) Two similarly charged silk cloths
repel.

It took scientists a long time to discover what lay behind these two types of charges. The word electric itself comes from the
Greek word elektron for amber, because the ancient Greeks noticed that amber, when rubbed by fur, attracts dry straw. Almost
2,000 years later, the English physicist William Gilbert proposed a model that explained the effect of electric charge as being due
to a mysterious electrical fluid that would pass from one object to another. This model was debated for several hundred years,
but it was finally put to rest in 1897 by the work of the English physicist J. J. Thomson and French physicist Jean Perrin. Along
with many others, Thomson and Perrin were studying the mysterious cathode rays that were known at the time to consist of
particles smaller than the smallest atom. Perrin showed that cathode rays actually carried negative electrical charge. Later,
Thomson’s work led him to declare, “I can see no escape from the conclusion that [cathode rays] are charges of negative

18.1 • Electrical Charges, Conservation of Charge, and Transfer of Charge

electricity carried by particles of matter.”
It took several years of further experiments to confirm Thomson’s interpretation of the experiments, but science had in fact
discovered the particle that carries the fundamental unit of negative electrical charge. We now know this particle as the
electron.
Atoms, however, were known to be electrically neutral, which means that they carry the same amount of positive and negative
charge, so their net charge is zero. Because electrons are negative, some other part of the atom must contain positive charge.
Thomson put forth what is called the plum pudding model, in which he described atoms as being made of thousands of
electrons swimming around in a nebulous mass of positive charge, as shown by the left-side image of Figure 18.3. His student,
Ernest Rutherford, originally believed that this model was correct and used it (along with other models) to try to understand the
results of his experiments bombarding gold foils with alpha particles (i.e., helium atoms stripped of their electrons). The results,
however, did not confirm Thomson’s model but rather destroyed it! Rutherford found that most of the space occupied by the gold
atoms was actually empty and that almost all of the matter of each atom was concentrated into a tiny, extremely dense nucleus,
as shown by the right-side image of Figure 18.3. The atomic nucleus was later found to contain particles called protons, each of
which carries a unit of positive electric charge.1

Figure 18.3 The left drawing shows Thompson’s plum-pudding model, in which the electrons swim around in a nebulous mass of positive
charge. The right drawing shows Rutherford’s model, in which the electrons orbit around a tiny, massive nucleus. Note that the size of the
nucleus is vastly exaggerated in this drawing. Were it drawn to scale with respect to the size of the electron orbits, the nucleus would not be
visible to the naked eye in this drawing. Also, as far as science can currently detect, electrons are point particles, which means that they
have no size at all!

Protons and electrons are thus the fundamental particles that carry electric charge. Each proton carries one unit of positive
charge, and each electron carries one unit of negative charge. To the best precision that modern technology can provide, the
charge carried by a proton is exactly the opposite of that carried by an electron. The SI unit for electric charge is the coulomb
(abbreviated as “C”), which is named after the French physicist Charles Augustin de Coulomb, who studied the force between
and the electron carries

charged objects. The proton carries
protons required to make +1.00 C is

The same number of electrons is required to make −1.00 C of electric charge. The fundamental unit of charge is often
represented as e. Thus, the charge on a proton is e, and the charge on an electron is −e. Mathematically,

LINKS TO PHYSICS
Measuring the Fundamental Electric Charge

The American physicist Robert Millikan (1868–1953) and his student Harvey Fletcher (1884–1981) were the first to make a
relatively accurate measurement of the fundamental unit of charge on the electron. They designed what is now a classic
1Protons were later found to contain sub particles called quarks, which have fractional electric charge. But that is another story that we leave for
subsequent physics courses.

experiment performed by students. The Millikan oil-drop experiment is shown in Figure 18.4. The experiment involves some
concepts that will be introduced later, but the basic idea is that a fine oil mist is sprayed between two plates that can be charged
with a known amount of opposite charge. Some oil drops accumulate some excess negative charge when being sprayed and are
attracted to the positive charge of the upper plate and repelled by the negative charge on the lower plate. By tuning the charge on
these plates until the weight of the oil drop is balanced by the electric forces, the net charge on the oil drop can be determined
quite precisely.

Figure 18.4 The oil-drop experiment involved spraying a fine mist of oil between two metal plates charged with opposite charges. By
knowing the mass of the oil droplets and adjusting the electric charge on the plates, the charge on the oil drops can be determined with
precision.

Millikan and Fletcher found that the drops would accumulate charge in discrete units of about
which is
within 1 percent of the modern value of
Although this difference may seem quite small, it is actually five
times greater than the possible error Millikan reported for his results!
Because the charge on the electron is a fundamental constant of nature, determining its precise value is very important for all of
science. This created pressure on Millikan and others after him that reveals some equally important aspects of human nature.
First, Millikan took sole credit for the experiment and was awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in physics for this work, although his
student Harvey Fletcher apparently contributed in significant ways to the work. Just before his death in 1981, Fletcher divulged
that Millikan coerced him to give Millikan sole credit for the work, in exchange for which Millikan promoted Fletcher’s career at
Bell Labs.
Another great scientist, Richard Feynman, points out that many scientists who measured the fundamental charge after Millikan
were reluctant to report values that differed much from Millikan’s value. History shows that later measurements slowly crept up
from Millikan’s value until settling on the modern value. Why did they not immediately find the error and correct the value, asks
Feynman. Apparently, having found a value higher than the much-respected value found by Millikan, scientists would look for
possible mistakes that might lower their value to make it agree better with Millikan’s value. This reveals the important
psychological weight carried by preconceived notions and shows how hard it is to refute them. Scientists, however devoted to
logic and data they may be, are apparently just as vulnerable to this aspect of human nature as everyone else. The lesson here is
that, although it is good to be skeptical of new results, you should not discount them just because they do not agree with
conventional wisdom. If your reasoning is sound and your data are reliable, the conclusion demanded by the data must be
seriously considered, even if that conclusion disagrees with the commonly accepted truth.

Conservation of Charge
Because the fundamental positive and negative units of charge are carried on protons and electrons, we would expect that the
total charge cannot change in any system that we define. In other words, although we might be able to move charge around, we
cannot create or destroy it. This should be true provided that we do not create or destroy protons or electrons in our system. In
the twentieth century, however, scientists learned how to create and destroy electrons and protons, but they found that charge is
still conserved. Many experiments and solid theoretical arguments have elevated this idea to the status of a law. The law of
conservation of charge says that electrical charge cannot be created or destroyed.
The law of conservation of charge is very useful. It tells us that the net charge in a system is the same before and after any
interaction within the system. Of course, we must ensure that no external charge enters the system during the interaction and
that no internal charge leaves the system. Mathematically, conservation of charge can be expressed as

where

is the net charge of the system before the interaction, and

is the net charge after the interaction.

WORKED EXAMPLE
What is the missing charge?

Figure 18.7 shows two spheres that initially have +4 C and +8 C of charge. After an interaction (which could simply be that they
touch each other), the blue sphere has +10 C of charge, and the red sphere has an unknown quantity of charge. Use the law of
conservation of charge to find the final charge on the red sphere.

sphere has a charge of +10 C. The law of conservation of charge allows us to find the final charge

Like all conservation laws, conservation of charge is an accounting scheme that helps us keep track of electric charge.

Conductors and Insulators
Materials can be classified depending on whether they allow charge to move. If charge can easily move through a material, such
as metals, then these materials are called conductors. This means that charge can be conducted (i.e., move) through the material
rather easily. If charge cannot move through a material, such as rubber, then this material is called an insulator.
Most materials are insulators. Their atoms and molecules hold on more tightly to their electrons, so it is difficult for electrons to
move between atoms. However, it is not impossible. With enough energy, it is possible to force electrons to move through an
insulator. However, the insulator is often physically destroyed in the process. In metals, the outer electrons are loosely bound to
their atoms, so not much energy is required to make electrons move through metal. Such metals as copper, silver, and
aluminum are good conductors. Insulating materials include plastics, glass, ceramics, and wood.
The conductivity of some materials is intermediate between conductors and insulators. These are called semiconductors. They
can be made conductive under the right conditions, which can involve temperature, the purity of the material, and the force
applied to push electrons through them. Because we can control whether semiconductors are conductors or insulators, these
materials are used extensively in computer chips. The most commonly used semiconductor is silicon. Figure 18.8 shows various
materials arranged according to their ability to conduct electrons.

Figure 18.8 Materials can be arranged according to their ability to conduct electric charge. The slashes on the arrow mean that there is a
very large gap in conducting ability between conductors, semiconductors, and insulators, but the drawing is compressed to fit on the page.
The numbers below the materials give their resistivity in Ω•m (which you will learn about below). The resistivity is a measure of how hard it
is to make charge move through a given material.

What happens if an excess negative charge is placed on a conducting object? Because like charges repel each other, they will push
against each other until they are as far apart as they can get. Because the charge can move in a conductor, it moves to the outer
surfaces of the object. Figure 18.9(a) shows schematically how an excess negative charge spreads itself evenly over the outer
surface of a metal sphere.
What happens if the same is done with an insulating object? The electrons still repel each other, but they are not able to move,
because the material is an insulator. Thus, the excess charge stays put and does not distribute itself over the object. Figure 18.9(b)
shows this situation.

Chapter 18 • Static Electricity

the outer surface of the sphere. (b) An insulating sphere with excess negative charge. The electrons cannot move, so they remain in their
original positions.

Transfer and Separation of Charge
Most objects we deal with are electrically neutral, which means that they have the same amount of positive and negative charge.
However, transferring negative charge from one object to another is fairly easy to do. When negative charge is transferred from
one object to another, an excess of positive charge is left behind. How do we know that the negative charge is the mobile charge?
The positive charge is carried by the proton, which is stuck firmly in the nucleus of atoms, and the atoms are stuck in place in
solid materials. Electrons, which carry the negative charge, are much easier to remove from their atoms or molecules and can
therefore be transferred more easily.
Electric charge can be transferred in several manners. One of the simplest ways to transfer charge is charging by contact, in
which the surfaces of two objects made of different materials are placed in close contact. If one of the materials holds electrons
more tightly than the other, then it takes some electrons with it when the materials are separated. Rubbing two surfaces
together increases the transfer of electrons, because it creates a closer contact between the materials. It also serves to present
fresh material with a full supply of electrons to the other material. Thus, when you walk across a carpet on a dry day, your shoes
rub against the carpet, and some electrons are removed from the carpet by your shoes. The result is that you have an excess of
negative charge on your shoes. When you then touch a doorknob, some of your excess of electrons transfer to the neutral
doorknob, creating a small spark.
Touching the doorknob with your hand demonstrates a second way to transfer electric charge, which is charging by conduction.
This transfer happens because like charges repel, and so the excess electrons that you picked up from the carpet want to be as far
away from each other as possible. Some of them move to the doorknob, where they will distribute themselves over the outer
surface of the metal. Another example of charging by conduction is shown in the top row of Figure 18.10. A metal sphere with
100 excess electrons touches a metal sphere with 50 excess electrons, so 25 electrons from the first sphere transfer to the second
sphere. Each sphere finishes with 75 excess electrons.
The same reasoning applies to the transfer of positive charge. However, because positive charge essentially cannot move in
solids, it is transferred by moving negative charge in the opposite direction. For example, consider the bottom row of Figure
18.10. The first metal sphere has 100 excess protons and touches a metal sphere with 50 excess protons, so the second sphere
transfers 25 electrons to the first sphere. These 25 extra electrons will electrically cancel 25 protons so that the first metal sphere
is left with 75 excess protons. This is shown in the bottom row of Figure 18.10. The second metal sphere lost 25 electrons so it has
25 more excess protons, for a total of 75 excess protons. The end result is the same if we consider that the first ball transferred a
net positive charge equal to that of 25 protons to the first ball.

18.1 • Electrical Charges, Conservation of Charge, and Transfer of Charge

Figure 18.10 In the top row, a metal sphere with 100 excess electrons transfers 25 electrons to a metal sphere with an excess of 50
electrons. After the transfer, both spheres have 75 excess electrons. In the bottom row, a metal sphere with 100 excess protons receives
25 electrons from a ball with 50 excess protons. After the transfer, both spheres have 75 excess protons.

In this discussion, you may wonder how the excess electrons originally got from your shoes to your hand to create the spark
when you touched the doorknob. The answer is that no electrons actually traveled from your shoes to your hands. Instead,
because like charges repel each other, the excess electrons on your shoe simply pushed away some of the electrons in your feet.
The electrons thus dislodged from your feet moved up into your leg and in turn pushed away some electrons in your leg. This
process continued through your whole body until a distribution of excess electrons covered the extremities of your body. Thus
your head, your hands, the tip of your nose, and so forth all received their doses of excess electrons that had been pushed out of
their normal positions. All this was the result of electrons being pushed out of your feet by the excess electrons on your shoes.
This type of charge separation is called polarization. As soon as the excess electrons leave your shoes (by rubbing off onto the
floor or being carried away in humid air), the distribution of electrons in your body returns to normal. Every part of your body is
again electrically neutral (i.e., zero excess charge).
The phenomenon of polarization is seen in . The child has accumulated excess positive charge by sliding on the slide. This excess
charge repels itself and so becomes distributed over the extremities of the child’s body, notably in his hair. As a result, the hair
stands on end, because the excess negative charge on each strand repels the excess positive charge on neighboring strands.
Polarization can be used to charge objects. Consider the two metallic spheres shown in Figure 18.11. The spheres are electrically
neutral, so they carry the same amounts of positive and negative charge. In the top picture (Figure 18.11(a)), the two spheres are
touching, and the positive and negative charge is evenly distributed over the two spheres. We then approach a glass rod that
carries an excess positive charge, which can be done by rubbing the glass rod with silk, as shown in Figure 18.11(b). Because
opposite charges attract each other, the negative charge is attracted to the glass rod, leaving an excess positive charge on the
opposite side of the right sphere. This is an example of charging by induction, whereby a charge is created by approaching a
charged object with a second object to create an unbalanced charge in the second object. If we then separate the two spheres, as
shown in Figure 18.11(c), the excess charge is stuck on each sphere. The left sphere now has an excess negative charge, and the
right sphere has an excess positive charge. Finally, in the bottom picture, the rod is removed, and the opposite charges attract
each other, so they move as close together as they can get.

Create a Spark in a Science Fair

Van de Graaff generators are devices that are used not only for serious physics research but also for demonstrating the physics of
static electricity at science fairs and in classrooms. Because they deliver relatively little electric current, they can be made safe
for use in such environments. The first such generator was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 for use in nuclear physics
research. Figure 18.12 shows a simplified sketch of a Van de Graaff generator.
Van de Graaff generators use smooth and pointed surfaces and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges. In the
version shown in Figure 18.12, electrons are “sprayed” from the tips of the lower comb onto a moving belt, which is made of an
insulating material like, such as rubber. This technique of charging the belt is akin to charging your shoes with electrons by
walking across a carpet. The belt raises the charges up to the upper comb, where they transfer again, akin to your touching the
doorknob and transferring your charge to it. Because like charges repel, the excess electrons all rush to the outer surface of the
globe, which is made of metal (a conductor). Thus, the comb itself never accumulates too much charge, because any charge it
gains is quickly depleted by the charge moving to the outer surface of the globe.

Van de Graaff generators are used to demonstrate many interesting effects caused by static electricity. By touching the globe, a
person gains excess charge, so his or her hair stands on end, as shown in Figure 18.13. You can also create mini lightning bolts by
moving a neutral conductor toward the globe. Another favorite is to pile up aluminum muffin tins on top of the uncharged
globe, then turn on the generator. Being made of conducting material, the tins accumulate excess charge. They then repel each
other and fly off the globe one by one. A quick Internet search will show many examples of what you can do with a Van de Graaff

Section Key Terms
Coulomb’s law

inverse-square law

More than 100 years before Thomson and Rutherford discovered the fundamental particles that carry positive and negative
electric charges, the French scientist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb mathematically described the force between charged
objects. Doing so required careful measurements of forces between charged spheres, for which he built an ingenious device
called a torsion balance.
This device, shown in Figure 18.15, contains an insulating rod that is hanging by a thread inside a glass-walled enclosure. At one
end of the rod is the metallic sphere A. When no charge is on this sphere, it touches sphere B. Coulomb would touch the spheres
with a third metallic ball (shown at the bottom of the diagram) that was charged. An unknown amount of charge would
distribute evenly between spheres A and B, which would then repel each other, because like charges repel. This force would cause
sphere A to rotate away from sphere B, thus twisting the wire until the torsion in the wire balanced the electrical force. Coulomb
then turned the knob at the top, which allowed him to rotate the thread, thus bringing sphere A closer to sphere B. He found
that bringing sphere A twice as close to sphere B required increasing the torsion by a factor of four. Bringing the sphere three
times closer required a ninefold increase in the torsion. From this type of measurement, he deduced that the electrical force
between the spheres was inversely proportional to the distance squared between the spheres. In other words,
18.5
where r is the distance between the spheres.
An electrical charge distributes itself equally between two conducting spheres of the same size. Knowing this allowed Coulomb
to divide an unknown charge in half. Repeating this process would produce a sphere with one quarter of the initial charge, and

so on. Using this technique, he measured the force between spheres A and B when they were charged with different amounts of
charge. These measurements led him to deduce that the force was proportional to the charge on each sphere, or

where

is the charge on sphere A, and

is the charge on sphere B.

Figure 18.15 A drawing of Coulomb’s torsion balance, which he used to measure the electrical force between charged spheres. (credit:
Charles-Augustin de Coulomb)

Combining these two proportionalities, he proposed the following expression to describe the force between the charged
spheres.
18.7
This equation is known as Coulomb’s law, and it describes the electrostatic force between charged objects. The constant of
proportionality k is called Coulomb’s constant. In SI units, the constant k has the value
The direction of the force is along the line joining the centers of the two objects. If the two charges are of opposite signs,
Coulomb’s law gives a negative result. This means that the force between the particles is attractive. If the two charges have the
same signs, Coulomb’s law gives a positive result. This means that the force between the particles is repulsive. For example, if
and
are negative or if both are positive, the force between them is repulsive. This is shown in Figure 18.16(a). If

both
negative charge and
is a positive charge (or vice versa), then the charges are different, so the force between them is attractive.
This is shown in Figure 18.16(b).

Figure 18.16 The magnitude of the electrostatic force F between point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r is given by Coulomb’s
law. Note that Newton’s third law (every force exerted creates an equal and opposite force) applies as usual—the force (F1,2) on q1 is equal
in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force (F2,1) it exerts on q2. (a) Like charges. (b) Unlike charges.

Note that Coulomb’s law applies only to charged objects that are not moving with respect to each other. The law says that the
force is proportional to the amount of charge on each object and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the
objects. If we double the charge , for instance, then the force is doubled. If we double the distance between the objects, then
the force between them decreases by a factor of
. Although Coulomb’s law is true in general, it is easiest to apply to
spherical objects or to objects that are much smaller than the distance between the objects (in which case, the objects can be
approximated as spheres).

563

564

Chapter 18 • Static Electricity

Coulomb’s law is an example of an inverse-square law, which means the force depends on the square of the denominator.
Another inverse-square law is Newton’s law of universal gravitation, which is
. Although these laws are similar,
they differ in two important respects: (i) The gravitational constant G is much, much smaller than k
); and (ii) only one type of mass exists, whereas two types of electric charge exist. These two
(
differences explain why gravity is so much weaker than the electrostatic force and why gravity is only attractive, whereas the
electrostatic force can be attractive or repulsive.
Finally, note that Coulomb measured the distance between the spheres from the centers of each sphere. He did not explain this
assumption in his original papers, but it turns out to be valid. From outside a uniform spherical distribution of charge, it can be
treated as if all the charge were located at the center of the sphere.

electric field

test charge

You may have heard of a force field in science fiction movies, where such fields apply forces at particular positions in space to
keep a villain trapped or to protect a spaceship from enemy fire. The concept of a field is very useful in physics, although it
differs somewhat from what you see in movies.
A field is a way of conceptualizing and mapping the force that surrounds any object and acts on another object at a distance
without apparent physical connection. For example, the gravitational field surrounding Earth and all other masses represents
the gravitational force that would be experienced if another mass were placed at a given point within the field. Michael Faraday,
an English physicist of the nineteenth century, proposed the concept of an electric field. If you know the electric field, then you
can easily calculate the force (magnitude and direction) applied to any electric charge that you place in the field.
An electric field is generated by electric charge and tells us the force per unit charge at all locations in space around a charge
distribution. The charge distribution could be a single point charge; a distribution of charge over, say, a flat plate; or a more
complex distribution of charge. The electric field extends into space around the charge distribution. Now consider placing a test
charge in the field. A test charge is a positive electric charge whose charge is so small that it does not significantly disturb the
charges that create the electric field. The electric field exerts a force on the test charge in a given direction. The force exerted is
proportional to the charge of the test charge. For example, if we double the charge of the test charge, the force exerted on it
doubles. Mathematically, saying that electric field is the force per unit charge is written as
18.15
where we are considering only electric forces. Note that the electric field is a vector field that points in the same direction as the
force on the positive test charge. The units of electric field are N/C.
If the electric field is created by a point charge or a sphere of uniform charge, then the magnitude of the force between this point
charge Q and the test charge is given by Coulomb’s law

where the absolute value is used, because we only consider the magnitude of the force. The magnitude of the electric field is then

567

568

Chapter 18 • Static Electricity

18.16
This equation gives the magnitude of the electric field created by a point charge Q. The distance r in the denominator is the
distance from the point charge, Q, or from the center of a spherical charge, to the point of interest.
If the test charge is removed from the electric field, the electric field still exists. To create a three-dimensional map of the
electric field, imagine placing the test charge in various locations in the field. At each location, measure the force on the charge,
and use the vector equation
to calculate the electric field. Draw an arrow at each point where you place the test
charge to represent the strength and the direction of the electric field. The length of the arrows should be proportional to the
strength of the electric field. If you join together these arrows, you obtain lines. Figure 18.17 shows an image of the threedimensional electric field created by a positive charge.

Figure 18.17 Three-dimensional representation of the electric field generated by a positive charge.

Just drawing the electric field lines in a plane that slices through the charge gives the two-dimensional electric-field maps shown
in Figure 18.18. On the left is the electric field created by a positive charge, and on the right is the electric field created by a
negative charge.
Notice that the electric field lines point away from the positive charge and toward the negative charge. Thus, a positive test
charge placed in the electric field of the positive charge will be repelled. This is consistent with Coulomb’s law, which says that
like charges repel each other. If we place the positive charge in the electric field of the negative charge, the positive charge is
attracted to the negative charge. The opposite is true for negative test charges. Thus, the direction of the electric field lines is
consistent with what we find by using Coulomb’s law.
says that the electric field gets stronger as we approach the charge that generates it. For example, at
The equation
2 cm from the charge Q (r = 2 cm), the electric field is four times stronger than at 4 cm from the charge (r = 4 cm). Looking at
Figure 18.17 and Figure 18.18 again, we see that the electric field lines become denser as we approach the charge that generates
it. In fact, the density of the electric field lines is proportional to the strength of the electric field!

Figure 18.18 Electric field lines from two point charges. The red point on the left carries a charge of +1 nC, and the blue point on the right
carries a charge of –1 nC. The arrows point in the direction that a positive test charge would move. The field lines are denser as you
approach the point charge.

Electric-field maps can be made for several charges or for more complicated charge distributions. The electric field due to
multiple charges may be found by adding together the electric field from each individual charge. Because this sum can only be a
single number, we know that only a single electric-field line can go through any given point. In other words, electric-field lines
cannot cross each other.
Figure 18.19(a) shows a two-dimensional map of the electric field generated by a charge of +q and a nearby charge of −q. The
three-dimensional version of this map is obtained by rotating this map about the axis that goes through both charges. A positive

test charge placed in this field would experience a force in the direction of the field lines at its location. It would thus be repelled
from the positive charge and attracted to the negative charge. Figure 18.19(b) shows the electric field generated by two charges of
−q. Note how the field lines tend to repel each other and do not overlap. A positive test charge placed in this field would be
attracted to both charges. If you are far from these two charges, where far means much farther than the distance between the
charges, the electric field looks like the electric field from a single charge of −2q.

STRATEGY
We know the electric field extends out from positive charge and terminates on negative charge. We also know that the number
of electric field lines that touch a charge is proportional to the charge. Charge 1 has 12 fields coming out of it. Charge 2 has six
field lines going into it. Charge 3 has 12 field lines going into it.
Solution
The electric-field lines come out of charge 1, so it is a positive charge. The electric-field lines go into charges 2 and 3, so they are

Discussion
Although we cannot determine the precise charge on each particle, we can get a lot of information from the electric field
regarding the magnitude and sign of the charges and where the force on a test charge would be greatest (or least).

What is
A doorknob, which can be taken to be a spherical metal conductor, acquires a static electricity charge of
the electric field 1.0 cm in front of the doorknob? The diameter of the doorknob is 5.0 cm.
STRATEGY
Because the doorknob is a conductor, the entire charge is distributed on the outside surface of the metal. In addition, because
the doorknob is assumed to be perfectly spherical, the charge on the surface is uniformly distributed, so we can treat the
doorknob as if all the charge were located at the center of the doorknob. The validity of this simplification will be proved in a

If the diameter of the doorknob is 5.0 cm, its radius is 2.5 cm. We want to know the electric field 1.0 cm from the surface of the
doorknob, which is a distance
from the center of the doorknob. We can use the equation
to find the magnitude of the electric field. The direction of the electric field is determined by the sign of the charge,
which is negative in this case.

This seems like an enormous electric field. Luckily, it takes an electric field roughly 100 times stronger (
) to cause

feel a force on the protons in your hand as you reach for the doorknob? The reason is that your hand contains an equal amount of

electric potential energy

As you learned in studying gravity, a mass in a gravitational field has potential energy, which means it has the potential to
accelerate and thereby increase its kinetic energy. This kinetic energy can be used to do work. For example, imagine you want to
use a stone to pound a nail into a piece of wood. You first lift the stone high above the nail, which increases the potential energy
of the stone-Earth system—because Earth is so large, it does not move, so we usually shorten this by saying simply that the
potential energy of the stone increases. When you drop the stone, gravity converts the potential energy into kinetic energy.
When the stone hits the nail, it does work by pounding the nail into the wood. The gravitational potential energy is the work that
a mass can potentially do by virtue of its position in a gravitational field. Potential energy is a very useful concept, because it can
be used with conservation of energy to calculate the motion of masses in a gravitational field.
Electric potential energy works much the same way, but it is based on the electric field instead of the gravitational field. By
virtue of its position in an electric field, a charge has an electric potential energy. If the charge is free to move, the force due to
the electric field causes it to accelerate, so its potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, just like a mass that falls in a
gravitational field. This kinetic energy can be used to do work. The electric potential energy is the work that a charge can do by
virtue of its position in an electric field.
The analogy between gravitational potential energy and electric potential energy is depicted in Figure 18.21. On the left, the ballEarth system gains gravitational potential energy when the ball is higher in Earth's gravitational field. On the right, the twocharge system gains electric potential energy when the positive charge is farther from the negative charge.

Figure 18.21 On the left, the gravitational field points toward Earth. The higher the ball is in the gravitational field, the higher the potential
energy is of the Earth-ball system. On the right, the electric field points toward a negative charge. The farther the positive charge is from the
negative charge, the higher the potential energy is of the two-charge system.

Let’s use the symbol
to denote gravitational potential energy. When a mass falls in a gravitational field, its gravitational
potential energy decreases. Conservation of energy tells us that the work done by the gravitational field to make the mass
to denote this work, then
accelerate must equal the loss of potential energy of the mass. If we use the symbol

Analogy between Gravity and Electricity

This video discusses the analogy between gravitational potential energy and electric potential energy. It reviews the concepts of
work and potential energy and shows the connection between a mass in a uniform gravitation field, such as on Earth’s surface,
and an electric charge in a uniform electric field.
Click to view content (https://www.openstax.org/l/28grav-elec)
If the electric field is not constant, then the equation
is not valid, and deriving the electric potential
and
energy becomes more involved. For example, consider the electric potential energy of an assembly of two point charges
of the same sign that are initially very far apart. We start by placing charge
at the origin of our coordinate system. This
takes no electrical energy, because there is no electric field at the origin (because charge
is very far away). We then bring
in from very far away to a distance r from the center of charge
. This requires some effort, because the electric field
charge
of charge
applies a repulsive force on charge
. The energy it takes to assemble these two charges can be recuperated if we
let them fly apart again. Thus, the charges have potential energy when they are a distance r apart. It turns out that the electric
and
a distance r apart is
potential energy of a pair of point charges
18.23
To recap, if charges
and
are free to move, they can accumulate kinetic energy by flying apart, and this kinetic energy can
be used to do work. The maximum amount of work the two charges can do (if they fly infinitely far from each other) is given by
the equation above.
Notice that if the two charges have opposite signs, then the potential energy is negative. This means that the charges have more
potential to do work when they are far apart than when they are at a distance r apart. This makes sense: Opposite charges
attract, so the charges can gain more kinetic energy if they attract each other from far away than if they start at only a short
distance apart. Thus, they have more potential to do work when they are far apart. Figure 18.23 summarizes how the electric
potential energy depends on charge and separation.

18.4 • Electric Potential

Figure 18.23 The potential energy depends on the sign of the charges and their separation. The arrows on the charges indicate the
direction in which the charges would move if released. When charges with the same sign are far apart, their potential energy is low, as
shown in the top panel for two positive charges. The situation is the reverse for charges of opposite signs, as shown in the bottom panel.

Electric Potential
Recall that to find the force applied by a fixed charge Q on any arbitrary test charge q, it was convenient to define the electric
field, which is the force per unit charge applied by Q on any test charge that we place in its electric field. The same strategy is
used here with electric potential energy: We now define the electric potential V, which is the electric potential energy per unit
charge.
18.24
Normally, the electric potential is simply called the potential or voltage. The units for the potential are J/C, which are given the
name volt (V) after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827). From the equation
, the electric potential a
distance r from a point charge
is
18.25
This equation gives the energy required per unit charge to bring a charge
Mathematically, this is written as

Note that this equation actually represents a difference in electric potential. However, because the second term is zero, it is
normally not written, and we speak of the electric potential instead of the electric potential difference, or we just say the
potential difference, or voltage). Below, when we consider the electric potential energy per unit charge between two points not
infinitely far apart, we speak of electric potential difference explicitly. Just remember that electric potential and electric
potential difference are really the same thing; the former is used just when the electric potential energy is zero in either the
initial or final charge configuration.

we can drop the subscripts and simply write

Now let’s consider the electric potential in a uniform electric field. From the equation
potential difference in going from to in a uniform electric field E is

, we see that the

18.29

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Notice from the equation

that the electric field can be written as
18.30

which means that the electric field has units of V/m. Thus, if you know the potential difference between two points,
calculating the electric field is very simple—you simply divide the potential difference by the distance!
Notice that a positive charge in a region with high potential will experience a force pushing it toward regions of lower potential.
In this sense, potential is like pressure for fluids. Imagine a pipe containing fluid, with the fluid at one end of the pipe under
high pressure and the fluid at the other end of the pipe under low pressure. If nothing prevents the fluid from flowing, it will
flow from the high-pressure end to the low-pressure end. Likewise, a positive charge that is free to move will move from a
region with high potential to a region with lower potential.

LINKS TO PHYSICS
Electric Animals

Many animals generate and/or detect electric fields. This is useful for activities such as hunting, defense, navigation,
communication, and mating. Because salt water is a relatively good conductor, electric fish have evolved in all the world’s
oceans. These fish have intrigued humans since the earliest times. In the nineteenth century, parties were even organized where
the main attraction was getting a jolt from an electric fish! Scientists also studied electric fish to learn about electricity.
Alessandro Volta based his research that led to batteries in 1799 on electric fish. He even referred to batteries as artificial electric
organs, because he saw them as imitations of the electric organs of electric fish.
Animals that generate electricity are called electrogenic and those that detect electric fields are called electroreceptive. Most fish
that are electrogenic are also electroreceptive. One of the most well-known electric fish is the electric eel (see Figure 18.25),
which is both electrogenic and electroreceptive. These fish have three pairs of organs that produce the electric charge: the main
organ, Hunter’s organ, and Sach’s organ. Together, these organs account for more than 80percent of the fish’s body.
Electric eels can produce electric discharges of much greater voltage than what you would get from a standard wall socket. These
discharges can stun or even kill their prey. They also use low-intensity discharges to navigate. The electric fields they generate
reflect off nearby obstacles or animals and are then detected by electroreceptors in the eel’s skin. The three organs that produce
electricity contain electrolytes, which are substances that ionize when dissolved in water (or other liquids). An ionized atom or
molecule is one that has lost or gained at least one electron, so it carries a net charge. Thus, a liquid solution containing an
electrolyte conducts electricity, because the ions in the solution can move if an electric field is applied.
To produce large discharges, the main organ is used. It contains approximately 6,000 rows of electroplaques connected in a long
chain. Connected this way, the voltage between electroplaques adds up, creating a large final voltage. Each electroplaque
consists of a column of cells controlled by an excitor nerve. When triggered by the excitor nerve, the electroplaques allow ionized
sodium to flow through them, creating a potential difference between electroplaques. These potentials add up, and a large
current can flow through the electrolyte.
This geometry is reflected in batteries, which also use stacks of plates to produce larger potential differences.

Dentists use X-rays to image their patients’ teeth and bones. The X-ray tubes that generate X-rays contain an electron source
separated by about 10 cm from a metallic target. The electrons are accelerated from the source to the target by a uniform electric

The potential difference is positive, so the energy per unit positive charge is higher at the target than at the source. This means
that free positive charges would fall from the target to the source. However, electrons are negative charges, so they accelerate

STRATEGY
As we did in the previous section, we treat the charge as if it were concentrated at the center of the doorknob. Again, as you will

Discussion
The energy is negative, which means that the energy will decrease that is, get even more negative as the speck of dust
approaches the doorknob. This helps explain why dust accumulates on objects that carry a static charge. However, note that
insulators normally collect more static charge than conductors, because any charge that accumulates on insulators cannot move
about on the insulator to find a way to escape. They must simply wait to be removed by some passing moist speck of dust or
other host.

Capacitors
Consider again the X-ray tube discussed in the previous sample problem. How can a uniform electric field be produced? A single
positive charge produces an electric field that points away from it, as in . This field is not uniform, because the space between
the lines increases as you move away from the charge. However, if we combine a positive and a negative charge, we obtain the
electric field shown in (a). Notice that, between the charges, the electric field lines are more equally spaced.
What happens if we place, say, five positive charges in a line across from five negative charges, as in Figure 18.27? Now the
region between the lines of charge contains a fairly uniform electric field.

Figure 18.27 The red dots are positive charges, and the blue dots are negative charges. The electric-field direction is shown by the red
arrows. Notice that the electric field between the positive and negative dots is fairly uniform.

We can extend this idea even further and into two dimensions by placing two metallic plates face to face and charging one with
positive charge and the other with an equal magnitude of negative charge. This can be done by connecting one plate to the
positive terminal of a battery and the other plate to the negative terminal, as shown in Figure 18.28. The electric field between
these charged plates will be extremely uniform.

Chapter 18 • Static Electricity

Figure 18.28 Two parallel metal plates are charged with opposite charge, by connecting the plates to the opposite terminals of a battery.
The magnitude of the charge on each plate is the same.

Let’s think about the work required to charge these plates. Before the plates are connected to the battery, they are neutral—that
is, they have zero net charge. Placing the first positive charge on the left plate and the first negative charge on the right plate
requires very little work, because the plates are neutral, so no opposing charges are present. Now consider placing a second
positive charge on the left plate and a second negative charge on the right plate. Because the first two charges repel the new
arrivals, a force must be applied to the two new charges over a distance to put them on the plates. This is the definition of work,
which means that, compared with the first pair, more work is required to put the second pair of charges on the plates. To place
the third positive and negative charges on the plates requires yet more work, and so on. Where does this work come from? The
battery! Its chemical potential energy is converted into the work required to separate the positive and negative charges.
Although the battery does work, this work remains within the battery-plate system. Therefore, conservation of energy tells us
that, if the potential energy of the battery decreases to separate charges, the energy of another part of the system must increase
by the same amount. In fact, the energy from the battery is stored in the electric field between the plates. This idea is analogous
to considering that the potential energy of a raised hammer is stored in Earth’s gravitational field. If the gravitational field were
to disappear, the hammer would have no potential energy. Likewise, if no electric field existed between the plates, no energy
would be stored between them.
If we now disconnect the plates from the battery, they will hold the energy. We could connect the plates to a lightbulb, for
example, and the lightbulb would light up until this energy was used up. These plates thus have the capacity to store energy. For
this reason, an arrangement such as this is called a capacitor. A capacitor is an arrangement of objects that, by virtue of their
geometry, can store energy an electric field.
Various real capacitors are shown in Figure 18.29. They are usually made from conducting plates or sheets that are separated by

an insulating material. They can be flat or rolled up or have other geometries.

Figure 18.29 Some typical capacitors. (credit: Windell Oskay)

The capacity of a capacitor is defined by its capacitance C, which is given by
18.35
where Q is the magnitude of the charge on each capacitor plate, and V is the potential difference in going from the negative
plate to the positive plate. This means that both Q and V are always positive, so the capacitance is always positive. We can see
from the equation for capacitance that the units of capacitance are C/V, which are called farads (F) after the nineteenth-century
English physicist Michael Faraday.
The equation
makes sense: A parallel-plate capacitor (like the one shown in Figure 18.28) the size of a football field
could hold a lot of charge without requiring too much work per unit charge to push the charge into the capacitor. Thus, Q would
be large, and V would be small, so the capacitance C would be very large. Squeezing the same charge into a capacitor the size of
a fingernail would require much more work, so V would be very large, and the capacitance would be much smaller.
Although the equation
makes it seem that capacitance depends on voltage, in fact it does not. For a given capacitor,
the ratio of the charge stored in the capacitor to the voltage difference between the plates of the capacitor always remains the
same. Capacitance is determined by the geometry of the capacitor and the materials that it is made from. For a parallel-plate
capacitor with nothing between its plates, the capacitance is given by
18.36
instead of C, because the capacitor has
where A is the area of the plates of the capacitor and d is their separation. We use

zero is called the permittivity of free space, and its value is
18.37
Coming back to the energy stored in a capacitor, we can ask exactly how much energy a capacitor stores. If a capacitor is charged
by putting a voltage V across it for example, by connecting it to a battery with voltage V—the electrical potential energy stored in
the capacitor is

Dielectrics
Before working through some sample problems, let’s look at what happens if we put an insulating material between the plates of
a capacitor that has been charged and then disconnected from the charging battery, as illustrated in Figure 18.30. Because the
material is insulating, the charge cannot move through it from one plate to the other, so the charge Q on the capacitor does not
change. An electric field exists between the plates of a charged capacitor, so the insulating material becomes polarized, as shown
in the lower part of the figure. An electrically insulating material that becomes polarized in an electric field is called a dielectric.

585

586

Chapter 18 • Static Electricity

Figure 18.30 shows that the negative charge in the molecules in the material shifts to the left, toward the positive charge of the
capacitor. This shift is due to the electric field, which applies a force to the left on the electrons in the molecules of the dielectric.
The right sides of the molecules are now missing a bit of negative charge, so their net charge is positive.

Figure 18.30 The top and bottom capacitors carry the same charge Q. The top capacitor has no dielectric between its plates. The bottom
capacitor has a dielectric between its plates. The molecules in the dielectric are polarized by the electric field of the capacitor.

All electrically insulating materials are dielectrics, but some are better dielectrics than others. A good dielectric is one whose
molecules allow their electrons to shift strongly in an electric field. In other words, an electric field pulls their electrons a fair bit
away from their atom, but they do not escape completely from their atom (which is why they are insulators).
Figure 18.31 shows a macroscopic view of a dielectric in a charged capacitor. Notice that the electric-field lines in the capacitor
with the dielectric are spaced farther apart than the electric-field lines in the capacitor with no dielectric. This means that the
electric field in the dielectric is weaker, so it stores less electrical potential energy than the electric field in the capacitor with no
dielectric.

18.5 • Capacitors and Dielectrics

Where has this energy gone? In fact, the molecules in the dielectric act like tiny springs, and the energy in the electric field goes
into stretching these springs. With the electric field thus weakened, the voltage difference between the two sides of the capacitor
is smaller, so it becomes easier to put more charge on the capacitor. Placing a dielectric in a capacitor before charging it
therefore allows more charge and potential energy to be stored in the capacitor. A parallel plate with a dielectric has a
capacitance of

capacitance increases when a dielectric is placed between the capacitor plates. The dielectric constant of several materials is

Chapter 18 • Static Electricity

Figure 18.31 The top and bottom capacitors carry the same charge Q. The top capacitor has no dielectric between its plates. The bottom
capacitor has a dielectric between its plates. Because some electric-field lines terminate and start on polarization charges in the dielectric,
the electric field is less strong in the capacitor. Thus, for the same charge, a capacitor stores less energy when it contains a dielectric.

SECTION SUMMARY
18.1 Electrical Charges,
Conservation of Charge, and
Transfer of Charge
• Electric charge is a conserved quantity, which means it
can be neither created nor destroyed.
• Electric charge comes in two varieties, which are called
positive and negative.
• Charges with the same sign repel each other. Charges
with opposite signs attract each other.
• Charges can move easily in conducting material.
Charges cannot move easily in an insulating material.
• Objects can be charged in three ways: by contact, by
conduction, and by induction.
• Although a polarized object may be neutral, its electrical
charge is unbalanced, so one side of the object has
excess negative charge and the other side has an equal
magnitude of excess positive charge.

18.2 Coulomb's law
• Coulomb’s law is an inverse square law and describes
the electrostatic force between particles.
• The electrostatic force between charged objects is
proportional to the charge on each object and inversely
proportional to the distance squared between the
objects.
• If Coulomb’s law gives a negative result, the force is
attractive; if the result is positive, the force is repulsive.

18.3 Electric Field
• The electric field defines the force per unit charge in the
space around a charge distribution.

• For a point charge or a sphere of uniform charge, the
electric field is inversely proportional to the distance
from the point charge or from the center of the sphere.
• Electric-field lines never cross each other.
• More force is applied to a charge in a region with many
electric field lines than in a region with few electric field
lines.
• Electric field lines start at positive charges and point
away from positive charges. They end at negative
charges and point toward negative charges.

18.4 Electric Potential
• Electric potential energy is a concept similar to
gravitational potential energy: It is the potential that
charges have to do work by virtue of their positions
relative to each other.
• Electric potential is the electric potential energy per
unit charge.
• The potential is always measured between two points,
where one point may be at infinity.
• Positive charges move from regions of high potential to
regions of low potential.
• Negative charges move from regions of low potential to
regions of high potential.

18.5 Capacitors and Dielectrics
• The capacitance of a capacitor depends only on the
geometry of the capacitor and the materials from which
it is made. It does not depend on the voltage across the
capacitor.
• Capacitors store electrical energy in the electric field
between their plates.

ultrasound device sending a signal to a computer screen, the brain sending a message for a baby to twitch its toes, an electric
train pulling into a station, a hydroelectric plant sending energy to metropolitan and rural users—these and many other

of this technology, to improve our quality of life. Whereas the previous chapter concentrated on static electricity and the

Direct and Alternating Current
Just as water flows from high to low elevation, electrons that are free to move will travel from a place with low potential to a place
with high potential. A battery has two terminals that are at different potentials. If the terminals are connected by a conducting
wire, an electric current (charges) will flow, as shown in Figure 19.2. Electrons will then move from the low-potential terminal of
the battery (the negative end) through the wire and enter the high-potential terminal of the battery (the positive end).

Figure 19.2 A battery has a wire connecting the positive and negative terminals, which allows electrons to move from the negative terminal
to the positive terminal.

Electric current is the rate at which electric charge moves. A large current, such as that used to start a truck engine, moves a
large amount very quickly, whereas a small current, such as that used to operate a hand-held calculator, moves a small amount
of charge more slowly. In equation form, electric current I is defined as

where
is the amount of charge that flows past a given area and is the time it takes for the charge to move past the area.
The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), which is named in honor of the French physicist André-Marie Ampère
(1775–1836). One ampere is one coulomb per second, or
Electric current moving through a wire is in many ways similar to water current moving through a pipe. To define the flow of
water through a pipe, we can count the water molecules that flow past a given section of the pipe. As shown in Figure 19.3,
electric current is very similar. We count the number of electrical charges that flow past a section of a conductor; in this case, a
wire.

Figure 19.3 The electric current moving through this wire is the charge that moves past the cross-section A divided by the time it takes for
this charge to move past the section A.

19.1
Note that we assigned a positive charge to the charges in Figure 19.3. Normally, negative charges—electrons—are the mobile
charge in wires, as indicated in Figure 19.2. Positive charges are normally stuck in place in solids and cannot move freely.
However, because a positive current moving to the right is the same as a negative current of equal magnitude moving to the left,
as shown in Figure 19.4, we define conventional current to flow in the direction that a positive charge would flow if it could
move. Thus, unless otherwise specified, an electric current is assumed to be composed of positive charges.
Also note that one Coulomb is a significant amount of electric charge, so 5 A is a very large current. Most often you will see
current on the order of milliamperes (mA).

Snap Lab
Vegetable Current

This lab helps students understand how current works. Given that particles confined in a pipe cannot occupy the same
space, pushing more particles into one end of the pipe will force the same number of particles out of the opposite end. This
creates a current of particles.

supply of electrical energy. For a period of 30 s, count the number of peas you can push through the straw. When finished,
calculate the pea current by dividing the number of peas by the time in seconds.
Note that the flow of peas is based on the peas physically bumping into each other; electrons push each other along due to
mutually repulsive electrostatic forces.

The direction of conventional current is the direction that positive charge would flow. Depending on the situation, positive
charges, negative charges, or both may move. In metal wires, as we have seen, current is carried by electrons, so the negative
charges move. In ionic solutions, such as salt water, both positively charged and negatively charged ions move. This is also true
in nerve cells. Pure positive currents are relatively rare but do occur. History credits American politician and scientist Benjamin
Franklin with describing current as the direction that positive charges flow through a wire. He named the type of charge
associated with electrons negative long before they were known to carry current in so many situations.
As electrons move through a metal wire, they encounter obstacles such as other electrons, atoms, impurities, etc. The electrons
scatter from these obstacles, as depicted in Figure 19.5. Normally, the electrons lose energy with each interaction. 1 To keep the
electrons moving thus requires a force, which is supplied by an electric field. The electric field in a wire points from the end of
the wire at the higher potential to the end of the wire at the lower potential. Electrons, carrying a negative charge, move on
average (or drift) in the direction opposite the electric field, as shown in Figure 19.5.

Figure 19.5 Free electrons moving in a conductor make many collisions with other electrons and atoms. The path of one electron is shown.
The average velocity of free electrons is in the direction opposite to the electric field. The collisions normally transfer energy to the
conductor, so a constant supply of energy is required to maintain a steady current.

So far, we have discussed current that moves constantly in a single direction. This is called direct current, because the electric
charge flows in only one direction. Direct current is often called DC current.
Many sources of electrical power, such as the hydroelectric dam shown at the beginning of this chapter, produce alternating
current, in which the current direction alternates back and forth. Alternating current is often called AC current. Alternating
current moves back and forth at regular time intervals, as shown in Figure 19.6. The alternating current that comes from a
normal wall socket does not suddenly switch directions. Rather, it increases smoothly up to a maximum current and then
smoothly decreases back to zero. It then grows again, but in the opposite direction until it has reached the same maximum
value. After that, it decreases smoothly back to zero, and the cycle starts over again.
1This energy is transferred to the wire and becomes thermal energy, which is what makes wires hot when they carry a lot of current.

19.1 • Ohm's law

Figure 19.6 With alternating current, the direction of the current reverses at regular time intervals. The graph on the top shows the current
versus time. The negative maxima correspond to the current moving to the left. The positive maxima correspond to current moving to the
right. The current alternates regularly and smoothly between these two maxima.

Devices that use AC include vacuum cleaners, fans, power tools, hair dryers, and countless others. These devices obtain the
power they require when you plug them into a wall socket. The wall socket is connected to the power grid that provides an
alternating potential (AC potential). When your device is plugged in, the AC potential pushes charges back and forth in the
circuit of the device, creating an alternating current.
Many devices, however, use DC, such as computers, cell phones, flashlights, and cars. One source of DC is a battery, which
provides a constant potential (DC potential) between its terminals. With your device connected to a battery, the DC potential
pushes charge in one direction through the circuit of your device, creating a DC current. Another way to produce DC current is
by using a transformer, which converts AC potential to DC potential. Small transformers that you can plug into a wall socket are
used to charge up your laptop, cell phone, or other electronic device. People generally call this a charger or a battery, but it is a
transformer that transforms AC voltage into DC voltage. The next time someone asks to borrow your laptop charger, tell them
that you don’t have a laptop charger, but that they may borrow your converter.

Resistance and Ohm’s Law
As mentioned previously, electrical current in a wire is in many ways similar to water flowing through a pipe. The water current
that can flow through a pipe is affected by obstacles in the pipe, such as clogs and narrow sections in the pipe. These obstacles
slow down the flow of current through the pipe. Similarly, electrical current in a wire can be slowed down by many factors,
including impurities in the metal of the wire or collisions between the charges in the material. These factors create a resistance
to the electrical current. Resistance is a description of how much a wire or other electrical component opposes the flow of
charge through it. In the 19th century, the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854) found experimentally that current
through a conductor is proportional to the voltage drop across a current-carrying conductor.

19.1 • Ohm's law

The constant of proportionality is the resistance R of the material, which leads to

This relationship is called Ohm’s law. It can be viewed as a cause-and-effect relationship, with voltage being the cause and the
current being the effect. Ohm’s law is an empirical law like that for friction, which means that it is an experimentally observed
phenomenon. The units of resistance are volts per ampere, or V/A. We call a V/A an ohm, which is represented by the uppercase
Greek letter omega ( ). Thus,

Ohm’s law holds for most materials and at common temperatures. At very low temperatures, resistance may drop to zero
(superconductivity). At very high temperatures, the thermal motion of atoms in the material inhibits the flow of electrons,
increasing the resistance. The many substances for which Ohm’s law holds are called ohmic. Ohmic materials include good
conductors like copper, aluminum, and silver, and some poor conductors under certain circumstances. The resistance of ohmic
materials remains essentially the same for a wide range of voltage and current.

WATCH PHYSICS
Introduction to Electricity, Circuits, Current, and Resistance

This video presents Ohm’s law and shows a simple electrical circuit. The speaker uses the analogy of pressure to describe how
electric potential makes charge move. He refers to electric potential as electric pressure. Another way of thinking about electric
potential is to imagine that lots of particles of the same sign are crowded in a small, confined space. Because these charges have
the same sign (they are all positive or all negative), each charge repels the others around it. This means that lots of charges are
constantly being pushed towards the outside of the space. A complete electric circuit is like opening a door in the small space:
Whichever particles are pushed towards the door now have a way to escape. The higher the electric potential, the harder each
particle pushes against the others.

a. The amount of current through the circuit must decrease by half.

Solution
The slope of the line is the rise divided by the run. Looking at the lower-left square of the grid, we see that the line rises by 1 mA

Electric Circuits and Resistors
Now that we understand the concept of electric current, let’s see what we can do with it. As you are no doubt aware, the modern
lifestyle relies heavily on electrical devices. These devices contain ingenious electric circuits, which are complete, closed
pathways through which electric current flows. Returning to our water analogy, an electric circuit is to electric charge like a
network of pipes is to water: The electric circuit guides electric charge from one point to the next, running the charge through
various devices along the way to extract work or information.
Electric circuits are made from many materials and cover a huge range of sizes, as shown in Figure 19.8. Computers and cell
). The
phones contain electric circuits whose features can be as small as roughly a billionth of a meter (a nanometer, or
pathways that guide the current in these devices are made by ultraprecise chemical treatments of silicon or other
semiconductors. Large power systems, on the other hand, contain electric circuits whose features are on the scale of meters.
These systems carry such large electric currents that their physical dimensions must be relatively large.

Figure 19.8 The photo on the left shows a chip that contains complex integrated electric circuitry. Chips such as this are at the heart of
devices such as computers and cell phones. The photograph on the right shows some typical electric circuitry required for high-power
electric power transmission.

The pathways that form electric circuits are made from a conducting material, normally a metal in macroscopic circuits. For
example, copper wires inside your school building form the electrical circuits that power lighting, projectors, screens, speakers,
etc. To represent an electric circuit, we draw circuit diagrams. We use lines and symbols to represent the elements in the circuit.
A simple electric circuit diagram is shown on the left side of Figure 19.9. On the right side is an analogous water circuit, which
we discuss below.

Figure 19.9 On the left is a circuit diagram showing a battery (in red), a resistor (black zigzag element), and the current I. On the right is the
analogous water circuit. The pump is like the battery, the sand filter is like the resistor, the water current is like the electrical current, and
the reservoir is like the ground.

There are many different symbols that scientists and engineers use in circuit diagrams, but we will focus on four main symbols:
the wire, the battery or voltage source, resistors, and the ground. The thin black lines in the electric circuit diagram represent
the pathway that the electric charge must follow. These pathways are assumed to be perfect conductors, so electric charge can
move along these pathways without losing any energy. In reality, the wires in circuits are not perfect, but they come close
enough for our purposes.
The zigzag element labeled R is a resistor, which is a circuit element that provides a known resistance. Macroscopic resistors are
often color coded to indicate their resistance, as shown in Figure 19.10.
The red element in Figure 19.9 is a battery, with its positive and negative terminals indicated; the longer line represents the
positive terminal of the battery, and the shorter line represents the negative terminal. Note that the battery icon is not always
colored red; this is done in Figure 19.9 just to make it easy to identify.
Finally, the element labeled ground on the lower left of the circuit indicates that the circuit is connected to Earth, which is a
large, essentially neutral object containing an infinite amount of charge. Among other things, the ground determines the
potential of the negative terminal of the battery. Normally, the potential of the ground is defined to be zero:
. This

means that the entire lower wire in Figure 19.10 is at a voltage of zero volts.

Figure 19.10 Some typical resistors. The color bands indicate the value of the resistance of each resistor.

The electric current in Figure 19.9 is indicted by the blue line labeled I. The arrow indicates the direction in which positive charge
would flow in this circuit. Recall that, in metals, electrons are mobile charge carriers, so negative charges actually flow in the
opposite direction around this circuit (i.e., counterclockwise). However, we draw the current to show the direction in which
positive charge would move.
On the right side of Figure 19.9 is an analogous water circuit. Water at a higher pressure leaves the top of the pump, which is like
charges leaving the positive terminal of the battery. The water travels through the pipe, like the charges traveling through the
wire. Next, the water goes through a sand filter, which heats up as the water squeezes through. This step is like the charges
going through the resistor. When charges flow through a resistor, they do work to heat up the resistor. After flowing through the
sand filter, the water has converted its potential energy into heat, so it is at a lower pressure. Likewise, the charges exiting the
resistor have converted their potential energy into heat, so they are at a lower voltage. Recall that voltage is just potential energy
per charge. Thus, water pressure is analogous to electric potential energy (i.e., voltage). Coming back to the water circuit again,
we see that the water returns to the bottom of the pump, which is like the charge returning to the negative terminal of the
battery. The water pump uses a source of energy to pump the water back up to a high pressure again, giving it the pressure
required to go through the circuit once more. The water pump is like the battery, which uses chemical energy to increase the
voltage of the charge up to the level of the positive terminal.
The potential energy per charge at the positive terminal of the battery is the voltage rating of the battery. This voltage is like
water pressure in the upper pipe. Just like a higher pressure forces water to move toward a lower pressure, a higher voltage
forces electric charge to flow toward a lower voltage. The pump takes water at low pressure and does work on it, ejecting water at
a higher pressure. Likewise, a battery takes charge at a low voltage, does work on it, and ejects charge at a higher voltage.
Note that the current in the water circuit of Figure 19.9 is the same throughout the circuit. In other words, if we measured the
number of water molecules passing a cross-section of the pipe per unit time at any point in the circuit, we would get the same
answer no matter where in the circuit we measured. The same is true of the electrical circuit in the same figure. The electric
current is the same at all points in this circuit, including inside the battery and in the resistor. The electric current neither
speeds up in the wires nor slows down in the resistor. This would create points where too much or too little charge would be
bunched up. Thus, the current is the same at all points in the circuit shown in Figure 19.9.
Although the current is the same everywhere in both the electric and water circuits, the voltage or water pressure changes as you
move through the circuits. In the water circuit, the water pressure at the pump outlet stays the same until the water goes
through the sand filter, assuming no energy loss in the pipe. Likewise, the voltage in the electrical circuit is the same at all points
in a given wire, because we have assumed that the wires are perfect conductors. Thus, as indicated by the constant red color of
the upper wire in Figure 19.11, the voltage throughout this wire is constant at
. The voltage then drops as you go
through the resistor, but once you reach the blue wire, the voltage stays at its new level of
all the way to the negative
terminal of the battery (i.e., the blue terminal of the battery).

Use this simulation to better understand how resistance, voltage, and current are related. The simulation shows a battery
with a resistor connected between the terminals of the battery, as in the previous figure. You can modify the battery voltage
and the resistance. The simulation shows how electrons react to these changes. It also shows the atomic cores in the resistor

electrons passing through that spot. Record the number on the circuit diagram. Now do the same thing at each of the other
two spots in the circuit. What do you notice about the number of charges passing through each spot in 20 s? Remember that
that current is defined as the rate that charges flow through the circuit. What does this mean about the current through the
entire circuit?

With the voltage slider, give the battery a positive voltage. Notice that the electrons are spaced farther apart in the left

a. The voltage between static charges is directly proportional to the distance between them.
b. The voltage between static charges is directly proportional to square of the distance between them.
c. The voltage between static charges is inversely proportional to the distance between them.
d. The voltage between static charges is inversely proportional to square of the distance between them.

Other possible circuit elements include capacitors and switches. These are drawn as shown on the left side of Figure 19.12. A
switch is a device that opens and closes the circuit, like a light switch. It is analogous to a valve in a water circuit, as shown on
the right side of Figure 19.12. With the switch open, no current passes through the circuit. With the switch closed, it becomes
part of the wire, so the current passes through it with no loss of voltage.
The capacitor is labeled C on the left of Figure 19.12. A capacitor in an electrical circuit is analogous to a flexible membrane in a

615

616

Chapter 19 • Electrical Circuits

water circuit. When the switch is closed in the circuit of Figure 19.12, the battery forces electrical current to flow toward the
capacitor, charging the upper capacitor plate with positive charge. As this happens, the voltage across the capacitor plates
increases. This is like the membrane in the water circuit: When the valve is opened, the pump forces water to flow toward the
membrane, making it stretch to store the excess water. As this happens, the pressure behind the membrane increases.
Now if we open the switch, the capacitor holds the voltage between its plates because the charges have nowhere to go. Likewise,
if we close the valve, the water has nowhere to go and the membrane maintains the water pressure in the pipe between itself and
the valve.
If the switch is closed for a long time in the electric circuit or if the valve is open for a long time in the water circuit, the current
will eventually stop flowing because the capacitor or the membrane will have become completely charged. Each circuit is now in
the steady state, which means that its characteristics do not change over time. In this case, the steady state is characterized by
zero current, and this does not change as long as the switch or valve remains in the same position. In the steady state, no
electrical current passes through the capacitor, and no water current passes through the membrane. The voltage difference
between the capacitor plates will be the same as the battery voltage. In the water circuit, the pressure behind the membrane will
be the same as the pressure created by the pump.
Although the circuit in Figure 19.12 may seem a bit pointless because all that happens when the switch is closed is that the
capacitor charges up, it does show the capacitor’s ability to store charge. Thus, the capacitor serves as a reservoir for charge. This
property of capacitors is used in circuits in many ways. For example, capacitors are used to power circuits while batteries are
being charged. In addition, capacitors can serve as filters. To understand this, let’s go back to the water analogy. Suppose you
have a water hose and are watering your garden. Your friend thinks he’s funny, and kinks the hose. While the hose is kinked, you
experience no water flow. When he lets go, the water starts flowing again. If he does this really fast, you experience water-no
water-water-no water, and that’s really no way to water your garden. Now imagine that the hose is filling up a big bucket, and
you are watering from the bottom of the bucket. As long as you had water in your bucket to begin with and your friend doesn’t
kink the water hose for too long, you would be able to water your garden without the interruptions. Your friend kinking the
water hose is filtered by the big bucket’s supply of water, so it does not impact your ability to water the garden. We can think of
the interruptions in the current (be it water or electrical current) as noise. Capacitors act in an analogous way as the water
bucket to help filter out the noise. Capacitors have so many uses that it is very rare to find an electronic circuit that does not
include some capacitors.

Figure 19.12 On the left is an electrical circuit containing a battery, a switch, and a capacitor. On the left is the analogous water circuit with
a pump, a valve, and a stretchable membrane. The pump is like the battery, the valve is like the switch, and the stretchable membrane is
like the capacitor. When the switch is closed, electrical current flows as the capacitor charges and its voltage increases. Likewise in the
water circuit, when the valve is open, water current flows as the stretchable membrane stretches and the water pressure behind it
increases.

WORK IN PHYSICS
What It Takes to be an Electrical Engineer

Physics is used in a wide variety of fields. One field that requires a very thorough knowledge of physics is electrical engineering.
An electrical engineer can work on anything from the large-scale power systems that provide power to big cities to the nanoscale
electronic circuits that are found in computers and cell phones (Figure 19.13).
In working with power companies, you can be responsible for maintaining the power grid that supplies electrical power to large
areas. Although much of this work is done from an office, it is common to be called in for overtime duty after storms or other
natural events. Many electrical engineers enjoy this part of the job, which requires them to race around the countryside
repairing high-voltage transformers and other equipment. However, one of the more unpleasant aspects of this work is to
remove the carcasses of unfortunate squirrels or other animals that have wandered into the transformers.
Other careers in electrical engineering can involve designing circuits for cell phones, which requires cramming some 10 billion
transistors into an electronic chip the size of your thumbnail. These jobs can involve much work with computer simulations and
can also involve fields other than electronics. For example, the 1-m-diameter lenses that are used to make these circuits (as of
2015) are so precise that they are shipped from the manufacture to the chip fabrication plant in temperature-controlled trucks to
ensure that they are held within a certain temperature range. If they heat up or cool down too much, they deform ever so
slightly, rendering them useless for the ultrahigh precision photolithography required to manufacture these chips.
In addition to a solid knowledge of physics, electrical engineers must above all be practical. Consider, for example, how one
corporation managed to launch some anti-ballistic missiles at the White Sands Missile Test Range in New Mexico in the 1960s.
Before launch, the skin of the missile had to be at the same voltage as the rail from which it was launched. The rail was
connected to the ground by a large copper wire connected to a stake driven into the sandy earth. The missile, however, was
connected by an umbilical cord to the equipment in the control shed a few meters away, which was grounded via a different
grounding circuit. Before launching the missile, the voltage difference between the missile skin and the rail had to be less than
2.5 V. After an especially dry spell of weather, the missile could not be launched because the voltage difference stood at 5 V. A
group of electrical engineers, including the father of your author, stood around pondering how to reduce the voltage difference.
The situation was resolved when one of the engineers realized that urine contains electrolytes and conducts electricity quite

GRASP CHECK
When the circuit has reached the steady state, how does the voltage across the capacitor compare to the voltage of the
battery? What is the voltage across the resistor?
a. The voltage across the capacitor is greater than the voltage of the battery. In the steady state, no current flows
through this circuit, so the voltage across the resistor is zero.
b. The voltage across the capacitor is smaller than the voltage of the battery. In the steady state, finite current flows
through this circuit, so the voltage across the resistor is finite.
c. The voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage of the battery. In the steady state, no current flows
through this circuit, so the voltage across the resistor is zero.
d. The voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage of the battery. In the steady state, finite current flows

Resistors in Series and Equivalent Resistance
Now that we have a basic idea of how electrical circuits work, let’s see what happens in circuits with more than one circuit
element. In this section, we look at resistors in series. Components connected in series are connected one after the other in the
same branch of a circuit, such as the resistors connected in series on the left side of Figure 19.14.

Figure 19.14 On the left is an electric circuit with three resistors R1, R2, and R3 connected in series. On the right is an electric circuit with
one resistor Requiv that is equivalent to the combination of the three resistors R1, R2, and R3.

We will now try to find a single resistance that is equivalent to the three resistors in series on the left side of Figure 19.14. An
equivalent resistor is a resistor that has the same resistance as the combined resistance of a set of other resistors. In other
words, the same current will flow through the left and right circuits in Figure 19.14 if we use the equivalent resistor in the right
circuit.
According to Ohm’s law, the voltage drop V across a resistor when a current flows through it is
where I is the current in
amperes (A) and R is the resistance in ohms ( ). Another way to think of this is that V is the voltage necessary to make a current
I flow through a resistance R. Applying Ohm’s law to each resistor on the left circuit of Figure 19.14, we find that the voltage drop
across
is
, that across
is
, and that across
is
. The sum of these voltages equals the
voltage output of the battery, that is
19.9
You may wonder why voltages must add up like this. One way to understand this is to go once around the circuit and add up the
successive changes in voltage. If you do this around a loop and get back to the starting point, the total change in voltage should
be zero, because you end up at the same place that you started. To better understand this, consider the analogy of going for a
stroll through some hilly countryside. If you leave your car and walk around, then come back to your car, the total height you
gained in your stroll must be the same as the total height you lost, because you end up at the same place as you started. Thus, the
gravitational potential energy you gain must be the same as the gravitational potential energy you lose. The same reasoning
holds for voltage in going around an electric circuit. Let’s apply this reasoning to the left circuit in Figure 19.14. We start just
below the battery and move up through the battery, which contributes a voltage gain of

resistors. The voltage drops by

Resistors in Parallel
In the previous section, we learned that resistors in series are resistors that are connected one after the other. If we instead
combine resistors by connecting them next to each other, as shown in Figure 19.16, then the resistors are said to be connected in
parallel. Resistors are in parallel when both ends of each resistor are connected directly together.
Note that the tops of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the top of the each resistor is the same.
Likewise, the bottoms of the resistors are all connected to the same wire, so the voltage at the bottom of each resistor is the
same. This means that the voltage drop across each resistor is the same. In this case, the voltage drop is the voltage rating V of
the battery, because the top and bottom wires connect to the positive and negative terminals of the battery, respectively.
Although the voltage drop across each resistor is the same, we cannot say the same for the current running through each
resistor. Thus,
are not necessarily the same, because the resistors
do not necessarily have the same

resistance.
Note that the three resistors in Figure 19.16 provide three different paths through which the current can flow. This means that
the equivalent resistance for these three resistors must be less than the smallest of the three resistors. To understand this,
imagine that the smallest resistor is the only path through which the current can flow. Now add on the alternate paths by
connecting other resistors in parallel. Because the current has more paths to go through, the overall resistance (i.e., the
equivalent resistance) will decrease. Therefore, the equivalent resistance must be less than the smallest resistance of the parallel
resistors.

Figure 19.16 The left circuit diagram shows three resistors in parallel. The voltage V of the battery is applied across all three resistors. The
currents that flow through each branch are not necessarily equal. The right circuit diagram shows an equivalent resistance that replaces the
three parallel resistors.

To find the equivalent resistance
of the three resistors

Discussion
Although 0.62 A flows through the entire circuit, note that this current does not flow through each resistor. However, because

623

624

Chapter 19 • Electrical Circuits

electric charge must be conserved in a circuit, the sum of the currents going through each branch of the circuit must add up to
the current going through the battery. In other words, we cannot magically create charge somewhere in the circuit and add this
new charge to the current. Let’s check this reasoning by using Ohm’s law to find the current through each resistor.

19.32

As expected, these currents add up to give 0.62 A, which is the total current found going through the equivalent resistor. Also,
note that the smallest resistor has the largest current flowing through it, and vice versa.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Reasoning with Parallel Resistors

Without doing any calculation, what is the equivalent resistance of three identical resistors R in parallel?
STRATEGY
Three identical resistors R in parallel make three identical paths through which the current can flow. Thus, it is three times
easier for the current to flow through these resistors than to flow through a single one of them.
Solution
If it is three times easier to flow through three identical resistors R than to flow through a single one of them, the equivalent
resistance must be three times less: R/3.
Discussion
Let’s check our reasoning by calculating the equivalent resistance of three identical resistors R in parallel. The equation for the
equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel gives

19.33

Thus, our reasoning was correct. In general, when more paths are available through which the current can flow, the equivalent
resistance decreases. For example, if we have identical resistors R in parallel, the equivalent resistance would be R/10.

More complex connections of resistors are sometimes just combinations of series and parallel. Combinations of series and

are identified as either series or parallel, reduced to their equivalents, and further reduced until a single resistance is left. The

process is more time consuming than difficult.

Figure 19.17 This combination of seven resistors has both series and parallel parts. Each is identified and reduced to an equivalent
resistance, and these are further reduced until a single equivalent resistance is reached.

Let’s work through the four steps in Figure 19.17 to reduce the seven resistors to a single equivalent resistor. To avoid distracting
algebra, we’ll assume each resistor is 10 . In step 1, we reduce the two sets of parallel resistors circled by the blue dashed loop.
The upper set has three resistors in parallel and will be reduced to a single equivalent resistor

.

That was a lot of work, and you might be asking why we do it. It’s important for us to know the equivalent resistance of the
entire circuit so that we can calculate the current flowing through the circuit. Ohm’s law tells us that the current flowing through
a circuit depends on the resistance of the circuit and the voltage across the circuit. But to know the current, we must first know
the equivalent resistance.
Here is a general approach to find the equivalent resistor for any arbitrary combination of resistors:
1. Identify a group of resistors that are only in parallel or only in series.
2. For resistors in series, use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in series to reduce them to a single
equivalent resistance. For resistors in parallel, use the equation for the equivalent resistance of resistors in parallel to
reduce them to a single equivalent resistance.
3. Draw a new circuit diagram with the resistors from step 1 replaced by their equivalent resistor.
4. If more than one resistor remains in the circuit, return to step 1 and repeat. Otherwise, you are finished.

Robot

Robots have captured our collective imagination for over a century. Now, this dream of creating clever machines to do our dirty
work, or sometimes just to keep us company, is becoming a reality. Robotics has become a huge field of research and
development, with some technology already being commercialized. Think of the small autonomous vacuum cleaners, for
example.
Figure 19.18 shows just a few of the multitude of different forms robots can take. The most advanced humanoid robots can walk,
pour drinks, even dance (albeit not very gracefully). Other robots are bio-inspired, such as the dogbot shown in the middle
photograph of Figure 19.18. This robot can carry hundreds of pounds of load over rough terrain. The photograph on the right in
Figure 19.18 shows the inner workings of an M-block, developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These simplelooking blocks contain inertial wheels and electromagnets that allow them to spin and flip into the air and snap together in a
variety of shapes. By communicating wirelessly between themselves, they self-assemble into a variety of shapes, such as desks,
chairs, and someday maybe even buildings.
All robots involve an immense amount of physics and engineering. The simple act of pouring a drink has only recently been
mastered by robots, after over 30 years of research and development! The balance and timing that we humans take for granted is
in fact a very tricky act to follow, requiring excellent balance, dexterity, and feedback. To master this requires sensors to detect
balance, computing power to analyze the data and communicate the appropriate compensating actions, and joints and
actuators to implement the required actions.
In addition to sensing gravity or acceleration, robots can contain multiple different sensors to detect light, sound, temperature,
smell, taste, etc. These devices are all based on the physical principles that you are studying in this text. For example, the optics
used for robotic vision are similar to those used in your digital cameras: pixelated semiconducting detectors in which light is

Building a robot today is much less arduous than it was a few years ago. Numerous companies now offer kits for building
robots. These range in complexity something suitable for elementary school children to something that would challenge the best
professional engineers. If interested, you may find these easily on the Internet and start making your own robot today.

By the end of this section, you will be able to do the following:
• Define electric power and describe the electric power equation
• Calculate electric power in circuits of resistors in series, parallel, and complex arrangements

Section Key Terms
electric power
Power is associated by many people with electricity. Every day, we use electric power to run our modern appliances. Electric
power transmission lines are visible examples of electricity providing power. We also use electric power to start our cars, to run
our computers, or to light our homes. Power is the rate at which energy of any type is transferred; electric power is the rate at
which electric energy is transferred in a circuit. In this section, we’ll learn not only what this means, but also what factors
determine electric power.
To get started, let’s think of light bulbs, which are often characterized in terms of their power ratings in watts. Let us compare a
25-W bulb with a 60-W bulb (see Figure 19.20). Although both operate at the same voltage, the 60-W bulb emits more light
intensity than the 25-W bulb. This tells us that something other than voltage determines the power output of an electric circuit.

Access for free at openstax.org.

19.4 • Electric Power

Incandescent light bulbs, such as the two shown in Figure 19.20, are essentially resistors that heat up when current flows
through them and they get so hot that they emit visible and invisible light. Thus the two light bulbs in the photo can be
considered as two different resistors. In a simple circuit such as a light bulb with a voltage applied to it, the resistance
determines the current by Ohm’s law, so we can see that current as well as voltage must determine the power.

Figure 19.20 On the left is a 25-W light bulb, and on the right is a 60-W light bulb. Why are their power outputs different despite their
operating on the same voltage?

The formula for power may be found by dimensional analysis. Consider the units of power. In the SI system, power is given in
watts (W), which is energy per unit time, or J/s
19.47
Recall now that a voltage is the potential energy per unit charge, which means that voltage has units of J/C
19.48
We can rewrite this equation as

and substitute this into the equation for watts to get

But a Coulomb per second (C/s) is an electric current, which we can see from the definition of electric current,
, where
Q is the charge in coulombs and t is time in seconds. Thus, equation above tells us that electric power is voltage times current,
or
This equation gives the electric power consumed by a circuit with a voltage drop of V and a current of I.
For example, consider the circuit in Figure 19.21. From Ohm’s law, the current running through the circuit is
19.49
Thus, the power consumed by the circuit is
19.50
Where does this power go? In this circuit, the power goes primarily into heating the resistor in this circuit.

Figure 19.21 A simple circuit that consumes electric power.

In calculating the power in the circuit of Figure 19.21, we used the resistance and Ohm’s law to find the current. Ohm’s law gives
the current:
, which we can insert into the equation for electric power to obtain

633

634

Chapter 19 • Electrical Circuits

This gives the power in terms of only the voltage and the resistance.
We can also use Ohm’s law to eliminate the voltage in the equation for electric power and obtain an expression for power in
terms of just the current and the resistance. If we write Ohm’s law as
and use this to eliminate V in the equation
, we obtain

This gives the power in terms of only the current and the resistance.
Thus, by combining Ohm’s law with the equation
for electric power, we obtain two more expressions for power: one in
terms of voltage and resistance and one in terms of current and resistance. Note that only resistance (not capacitance or
anything else), current, and voltage enter into the expressions for electric power. This means that the physical characteristic of a
circuit that determines how much power it dissipates is its resistance. Any capacitors in the circuit do not dissipate electric
power—on the contrary, capacitors either store electric energy or release electric energy back to the circuit.
To clarify how voltage, resistance, current, and power are all related, consider Figure 19.22, which shows the formula wheel. The
quantities in the center quarter circle are equal to the quantities in the corresponding outer quarter circle. For example, to
express a potential V in terms of power and current, we see from the formula wheel that

Discussion
This is a significant current. Recall that household power is AC and not DC, so the 120 V supplied by household sockets is an
alternating power, not a constant power. The 120 V is actually the time-averaged power provided by such sockets. Thus, the
average current going through the light bulb over a period of time longer than a few seconds is 0.50 A.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Boot Warmers

To warm your boots on cold days, you decide to sew a circuit with some resistors into the insole of your boots. You want 10 W of
heat output from the resistors in each insole, and you want to run them from two 9-V batteries (connected in series). What total
resistance should you put in each insole?
STRATEGY
We know the desired power and the voltage (18 V, because we have two 9-V batteries connected in series), so we can use the

The total power dissipated by the circuit is the sum of the powers dissipated in each branch.

SECTION SUMMARY
19.1 Ohm's law

19.3 Parallel Circuits

• Direct current is constant over time; alternating current
alternates smoothly back and forth over time.
• Electrical resistance causes materials to extract work
from the current that flows through them.
• In ohmic materials, voltage drop along a path is
proportional to the current that runs through the path.

19.2 Series Circuits
• Circuit diagrams are schematic representations of
electric circuits.
• Resistors in series are resistors that are connected head
to tail.
• The same current runs through all resistors in series;
however, the voltage drop across each resistor can be
different.
• The voltage is the same at every point in a given wire.

• The equivalent resistance of a group of N identical
resistors R connected in parallel is R/N.
• Connecting resistors in parallel provides more paths for
the current to go through, so the equivalent resistance
is always less than the smallest resistance of the parallel
resistors.
• The same voltage drop occurs across all resistors in
parallel; however, the current through each resistor can
differ.

19.4 Electric Power
• Electric power is dissipated in the resistances of a
circuit. Capacitors do not dissipate electric power.
• Electric power is proportional to the voltage and the
current in a circuit.
• Ohm’s law provides two extra expressions for electric
power: one that does not involve current and one that
does not involve voltage.

INTRODUCTION You may have encountered magnets for the first time as a small child playing with magnetic toys or
refrigerator magnets. At the time, you likely noticed that two magnets that repulse each other will attract each other if you flip
one of them around. The force that acts across the air gaps between magnets is the same force that creates wonders such as the
Aurora Borealis. In fact, magnetic effects pervade our lives in myriad ways, from electric motors to medical imaging and
computer memory. In this chapter, we introduce magnets and learn how they work and how magnetic fields and electric

Magnets and Magnetization
People have been aware of magnets and magnetism for thousands of years. The earliest records date back to ancient times,
particularly in the region of Asia Minor called Magnesia—the name of this region is the source of words like magnet. Magnetic
rocks found in Magnesia, which is now part of western Turkey, stimulated interest during ancient times. When humans first
discovered magnetic rocks, they likely found that certain parts of these rocks attracted bits of iron or other magnetic rocks more
strongly than other parts. These areas are called the poles of a magnet. A magnetic pole is the part of a magnet that exerts the
strongest force on other magnets or magnetic material, such as iron. For example, the poles of the bar magnet shown in Figure
20.2 are where the paper clips are concentrated.

Figure 20.2 A bar magnet with paper clips attracted to the two poles.

If a bar magnet is suspended so that it rotates freely, one pole of the magnet will always turn toward the north, with the opposite
pole facing south. This discovery led to the compass, which is simply a small, elongated magnet mounted so that it can rotate
freely. An example of a compass is shown Figure 20.3. The pole of the magnet that orients northward is called the north pole,
and the opposite pole of the magnet is called the south pole.

20.1 • Magnetic Fields, Field Lines, and Force

Figure 20.3 A compass is an elongated magnet mounted in a device that allows the magnet to rotate freely.

The discovery that one particular pole of a magnet orients northward, whereas the other pole orients southward allowed people
to identify the north and south poles of any magnet. It was then noticed that the north poles of two different magnets repel each
other, and likewise for the south poles. Conversely, the north pole of one magnet attracts the south pole of other magnets. This
situation is analogous to that of electric charge, where like charges repel and unlike charges attract. In magnets, we simply
replace charge with pole: Like poles repel and unlike poles attract. This is summarized in Figure 20.4, which shows how the force
between magnets depends on their relative orientation.

Figure 20.4 Depending on their relative orientation, magnet poles will either attract each other or repel each other.

Consider again the fact that the pole of a magnet that orients northward is called the north pole of the magnet. If unlike poles
attract, then the magnetic pole of Earth that is close to the geographic North Pole must be a magnetic south pole! Likewise, the
magnetic pole of Earth that is close to the geographic South Pole must be a magnetic north pole. This situation is depicted in
Figure 20.5, in which Earth is represented as containing a giant internal bar magnet with its magnetic south pole at the
geographic North Pole and vice versa. If we were to somehow suspend a giant bar magnet in space near Earth, then the north
pole of the space magnet would be attracted to the south pole of Earth’s internal magnet. This is in essence what happens with a
compass needle: Its magnetic north pole is attracted to the magnet south pole of Earth’s internal magnet.

651

652

Chapter 20 • Magnetism

Figure 20.5 Earth can be thought of as containing a giant magnet running through its core. The magnetic south pole of Earth’s magnet is at
the geographic North Pole, so the north pole of magnets is attracted to the North Pole, which is how the north pole of magnets got their
name. Likewise, the south pole of magnets is attracted to the geographic South Pole of Earth.

What happens if you cut a bar magnet in half? Do you obtain one magnet with two south poles and one magnet with two north
poles? The answer is no: Each half of the bar magnet has a north pole and a south pole. You can even continue cutting each piece
of the bar magnet in half, and you will always obtain a new, smaller magnet with two opposite poles. As shown in Figure 20.6,
you can continue this process down to the atomic scale, and you will find that even the smallest particles that behave as magnets
have two opposite poles. In fact, no experiment has ever found any object with a single magnetic pole, from the smallest
subatomic particle such as electrons to the largest objects in the universe such as stars. Because magnets always have two poles,
they are referred to as magnetic dipoles—di means two. Below, we will see that magnetic dipoles have properties that are
analogous to electric dipoles.

Figure 20.6 All magnets have two opposite poles, from the smallest, such as subatomic particles, to the largest, such as stars.

a. The north pole of a compass needle is attracted to the north magnetic pole of Earth, which is located near the
geographic North Pole of Earth.
b. The north pole of a compass needle is attracted to the south magnetic pole of Earth, which is located near the
geographic North Pole of Earth.

Only certain materials, such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium, exhibit strong magnetic effects. Such materials are called
ferromagnetic, after the Latin word ferrum for iron. Other materials exhibit weak magnetic effects, which are detectable only
with sensitive instruments. Not only do ferromagnetic materials respond strongly to magnets—the way iron is attracted to
magnets—but they can also be magnetized themselves—that is, they can be induced to be magnetic or made into permanent
magnets (Figure 20.7). A permanent magnet is simply a material that retains its magnetic behavior for a long time, even when
exposed to demagnetizing influences.

Figure 20.7 An unmagnetized piece of iron is placed between two magnets, heated, and then cooled, or simply tapped when cold. The iron
becomes a permanent magnet with the poles aligned as shown: Its south pole is adjacent to the north pole of the original magnet, and its
north pole is adjacent to the south pole of the original magnet. Note that attractive forces are created between the central magnet and the
outer magnets.

When a magnet is brought near a previously unmagnetized ferromagnetic material, it causes local magnetization of the
material with unlike poles closest, as in the right side of Figure 20.7. This causes an attractive force, which is why unmagnetized
iron is attracted to a magnet.
What happens on a microscopic scale is illustrated in Figure 7(a). Regions within the material called domains act like small bar
magnets. Within domains, the magnetic poles of individual atoms are aligned. Each atom acts like a tiny bar magnet. Domains
are small and randomly oriented in an unmagnetized ferromagnetic object. In response to an external magnetic field, the
domains may grow to millimeter size, aligning themselves, as shown in Figure 7(b). This induced magnetization can be made
permanent if the material is heated and then cooled, or simply tapped in the presence of other magnets.

Figure 20.8 (a) An unmagnetized piece of iron—or other ferromagnetic material—has randomly oriented domains. (b) When magnetized by
an external magnet, the domains show greater alignment, and some grow at the expense of others. Individual atoms are aligned within

domains; each atom acts like a tiny bar magnet.

Conversely, a permanent magnet can be demagnetized by hard blows or by heating it in the absence of another magnet.
Increased thermal motion at higher temperature can disrupt and randomize the orientation and size of the domains. There is a
well-defined temperature for ferromagnetic materials, which is called the Curie temperature, above which they cannot be
), which is well above room temperature. There are several

You have one magnet with the north and south poles labeled. How can you use this magnet to identify the north and
south poles of other magnets?
a. If the north pole of a known magnet is repelled by a pole of an unknown magnet on bringing them closer, that pole
of unknown magnet is its north pole; otherwise, it is its south pole.
b. If the north pole of known magnet is attracted to a pole of an unknown magnet on bringing them closer, that pole
of unknown magnet is its north pole; otherwise, it is its south pole.

Magnetic Fields
We have thus seen that forces can be applied between magnets and between magnets and ferromagnetic materials without any
contact between the objects. This is reminiscent of electric forces, which also act over distances. Electric forces are described
using the concept of the electric field, which is a force field around electric charges that describes the force on any other charge
placed in the field. Likewise, a magnet creates a magnetic field around it that describes the force exerted on other magnets
placed in the field. As with electric fields, the pictorial representation of magnetic field lines is very useful for visualizing the
strength and direction of the magnetic field.
As shown in Figure 20.9, the direction of magnetic field lines is defined to be the direction in which the north pole of a compass
needle points. If you place a compass near the north pole of a magnet, the north pole of the compass needle will be repelled and
point away from the magnet. Thus, the magnetic field lines point away from the north pole of a magnet and toward its south
pole.

Figure 20.9 The black lines represent the magnetic field lines of a bar magnet. The field lines point in the direction that the north pole of a
small compass would point, as shown at left. Magnetic field lines never stop, so the field lines actually penetrate the magnet to form
complete loops, as shown at right.

20.1 • Magnetic Fields, Field Lines, and Force

Magnetic field lines can be mapped out using a small compass. The compass is moved from point to point around a magnet, and
at each point, a short line is drawn in the direction of the needle, as shown in Figure 20.10. Joining the lines together then
reveals the path of the magnetic field line. Another way to visualize magnetic field lines is to sprinkle iron filings around a
magnet. The filings will orient themselves along the magnetic field lines, forming a pattern such as that shown on the right in
Figure 20.10.

Using a Compass to Map Out the Magnetic Field

This simulation presents you with a bar magnet and a small compass. Begin by dragging the compass around the bar
magnet to see in which direction the magnetic field points. Note that the strength of the magnetic field is represented by the
brightness of the magnetic field icons in the grid pattern around the magnet. Use the magnetic field meter to check the field
strength at several points around the bar magnet. You can also flip the polarity of the magnet, or place Earth on the image to
see how the compass orients itself.

GRASP CHECK
With the slider at the top right of the simulation window, set the magnetic field strength to 100 percent . Now use the
magnetic field meter to answer the following question: Near the magnet, where is the magnetic field strongest and
where is it weakest? Don’t forget to check inside the bar magnet.
a. The magnetic field is strongest at the center and weakest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet. The
magnetic field lines are densest at the center and least dense between the two poles just outside the bar magnet.
b. The magnetic field is strongest at the center and weakest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet. The
magnetic field lines are least dense at the center and densest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet.
c. The magnetic field is weakest at the center and strongest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet. The
magnetic field lines are densest at the center and least dense between the two poles just outside the bar magnet.
d. The magnetic field is weakest at the center and strongest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet and the
magnetic field lines are least dense at the center and densest between the two poles just outside the bar magnet.

Figure 20.10 Magnetic field lines can be drawn by moving a small compass from point to point around a magnet. At each point, draw a
short line in the direction of the compass needle. Joining the points together reveals the path of the magnetic field lines. Another way to
visualize magnetic field lines is to sprinkle iron filings around a magnet, as shown at right.

When two magnets are brought close together, the magnetic field lines are perturbed, just as happens for electric field lines
when two electric charges are brought together. Bringing two north poles together—or two south poles—will cause a repulsion,
and the magnetic field lines will bend away from each other. This is shown in Figure 20.11, which shows the magnetic field lines
created by the two closely separated north poles of a bar magnet. When opposite poles of two magnets are brought together, the

655

656

Chapter 20 • Magnetism

magnetic field lines join together and become denser between the poles. This situation is shown in Figure 20.11.

Figure 20.11 (a) When two north poles are approached together, the magnetic field lines repel each other and the two magnets experience
a repulsive force. The same occurs if two south poles are approached together. (b) If opposite poles are approached together, the magnetic
field lines become denser between the poles and the magnets experience an attractive force.

Like the electric field, the magnetic field is stronger where the lines are denser. Thus, between the two north poles in Figure
20.11, the magnetic field is very weak because the density of the magnetic field is almost zero. A compass placed at that point
would essentially spin freely if we ignore Earth’s magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field lines between the north and
south poles in Figure 20.11 are very dense, indicating that the magnetic field is very strong in this region. A compass placed here
would quickly align with the magnetic field and point toward the south pole on the right.
Note that magnets are not the only things that make magnetic fields. Early in the nineteenth century, people discovered that
electrical currents cause magnetic effects. The first significant observation was by the Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted
(1777–1851), who found that a compass needle was deflected by a current-carrying wire. This was the first significant evidence
that the movement of electric charges had any connection with magnets. An electromagnet is a device that uses electric current
to make a magnetic field. These temporarily induced magnets are called electromagnets. Electromagnets are employed for
everything from a wrecking yard crane that lifts scrapped cars to controlling the beam of a 90-km-circumference particle
accelerator to the magnets in medical-imaging machines (see Figure 20.12).

The magnetic field created by an electric current in a long straight wire is shown in Figure 20.13. The magnetic field lines form
concentric circles around the wire. The direction of the magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule. This rule
shows up in several places in the study of electricity and magnetism. Applied to a straight current-carrying wire, the right-hand
rule says that, with your right thumb pointed in the direction of the current, the magnetic field will be in the direction in which
your right fingers curl, as shown in Figure 20.13. If the wire is very long compared to the distance r from the wire, the strength B

A long straight wire is placed on a table top and electric current flows through the wire from right to left. If you look at the
wire end-on from the left end, does the magnetic field go clockwise or counterclockwise?
a. By pointing your right-hand thumb in the direction opposite of current, the right-hand fingers will curl
counterclockwise, so the magnetic field will be in the counterclockwise direction.
b. By pointing your right-hand thumb in the direction opposite of current, the right-hand fingers will curl clockwise, so
the magnetic field will be in the clockwise direction.
c. By pointing your right-hand thumb in the direction of current, the right-hand fingers will curl counterclockwise, so the
magnetic field will be in the counterclockwise direction.
d. By pointing your right-hand thumb in the direction of current, the right-hand fingers will curl clockwise, so the
magnetic field will be in the clockwise direction.

Now imagine winding a wire around a cylinder with the cylinder then removed. The result is a wire coil, as shown in Figure
20.14. This is called a solenoid. To find the direction of the magnetic field produced by a solenoid, apply the right-hand rule to
several points on the coil. You should be able to convince yourself that, inside the coil, the magnetic field points from left to
right. In fact, another application of the right-hand rule is to curl your right-hand fingers around the coil in the direction in
which the current flows. Your right thumb then points in the direction of the magnetic field inside the coil: left to right in this
case.

Figure 20.14 A wire coil with current running through as shown produces a magnetic field in the direction of the red arrow.

Each loop of wire contributes to the magnetic field inside the solenoid. Because the magnetic field lines must form closed loops,
the field lines close the loop outside the solenoid. The magnetic field lines are much denser inside the solenoid than outside the
solenoid. The resulting magnetic field looks very much like that of a bar magnet, as shown in Figure 20.15. The magnetic field
strength deep inside a solenoid is

d. The magnetic field strength increases to four times of its initial value when number of loops reduces from four to

Magnetic Force
If a moving electric charge, that is electric current, produces a magnetic field that can exert a force on another magnet, then the
reverse should be true by Newton’s third law. In other words, a charge moving through the magnetic field produced by another
object should experience a force—and this is exactly what we find. As a concrete example, consider Figure 20.16, which shows a

Magnetohydrodynamic Drive

In Tom Clancy’s Cold War novel “The Hunt for Red October,” the Soviet Union built a submarine (see Figure 20.17) with a
magnetohydrodynamic drive that was so silent it could not be detected by surface ships. The only conceivable purpose to build
such a submarine was to give the Soviet Union first-strike capability, because this submarine could sneak close to the coast of
the United States and fire its ballistic missiles, destroying key military and government installations to prevent an American
counterattack.

Figure 20.17 A Typhoon-class Russian ballistic-missile submarine on which the fictional submarine Red October was based.

A magnetohydrodynamic drive is supposed to be silent because it has no moving parts. Instead, it uses the force experienced by
charged particles that move in a magnetic field. The basic idea behind such a drive is depicted in Figure 20.18. Salt water flows
through a channel that runs from the front to the back of the submarine. A magnetic field is applied horizontally across the
channel, and a voltage is applied across the electrodes on the top and bottom of the channel to force a downward electric current
through the water. The charge carriers are the positive sodium ions and the negative chlorine ions of salt. Using the right-hand

659

660

Chapter 20 • Magnetism

rule, the force on the charge carriers is found to be toward the rear of the vessel. The accelerated charges collide with water
molecules and transfer their momentum, creating a jet of water that is propelled out the rear of the channel. By Newton’s third
law, the vessel experiences a force of equal magnitude, but in the opposite direction.

Figure 20.18 A schematic drawing of a magnetohydrodynamic drive showing the water channel, the current direction, the magnetic field
direction, and the resulting force.

Fortunately for all involved, it turns out that such a propulsion system is not very practical. Some back-of-the-envelope
calculations show that, to power a submarine, either extraordinarily high magnetic fields or extraordinarily high electric
currents would be required to obtain a reasonable thrust. In addition, prototypes of magnetohydrodynamic drives show that
they are anything but silent. Electrolysis caused by running a current through salt water creates bubbles of hydrogen and
oxygen, which makes this propulsion system quite noisy. The system also leaves a trail of chloride ions and metal chlorides that
can easily be detected to locate the submarine. Finally, the chloride ions are extremely reactive and very quickly corrode metal
parts, such as the electrode or the water channel itself. Thus, the Red October remains in the realm of fiction, but the physics
involved is quite real.

charges produce electric fields, and moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. A magnetic dipole produces a magnetic
field, and, as we will see in the next section, moving magnetic dipoles produce an electric field. Thus, electricity and magnetism
are two intimately related and symmetric phenomena.

This seems like a very small force. However, the proton has a mass of

, or about ten thousand billion times the acceleration due to gravity!
We found that the proton’s initial acceleration as it enters the magnetic field is downward in the plane of the page. Notice that,
as the proton accelerates, its velocity remains perpendicular to the magnetic field, so the magnitude of the force does not
change. In addition, because of the right-hand rule, the direction of the force remains perpendicular to the velocity. This force is
nothing more than a centripetal force: It has a constant magnitude and is always perpendicular to the velocity. Thus, the
magnitude of the velocity does not change, and the proton executes circular motion. The radius of this circle may be found by
using the kinematics relationship.

The direction of the force is the same as the initial direction of the force was in the previous example for a proton. However,
because the current in a wire is confined to a wire, the direction in which the charges move does not change. Instead, the entire
wire accelerates in the -direction. The force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field is the basis of all electrical motors,
as we will see in the upcoming sections.

Electric Motors, Generators, and Transformers
As we learned previously, a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field experiences a force—recall
. Electric
motors, which convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, are the most common application of magnetic force on currentcarrying wires. Motors consist of loops of wire in a magnetic field. When current is passed through the loops, the magnetic field
exerts a torque on the loops, which rotates a shaft. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical work in the process. Figure 20.23
shows a schematic drawing of an electric motor.

Figure 20.23 Torque on a current loop. A vertical loop of wire in a horizontal magnetic field is attached to a vertical shaft. When current is
passed through the wire loop, torque is exerted on it, making it turn the shaft.

Let us examine the force on each segment of the loop in Figure 20.23 to find the torques produced about the axis of the vertical
shaft—this will lead to a useful equation for the torque on the loop. We take the magnetic field to be uniform over the
rectangular loop, which has width w and height as shown in the figure. First, consider the force on the top segment of the
loop. To determine the direction of the force, we use the right-hand rule. The current goes from left to right into the page, and
the magnetic field goes from left to right in the plane of the page. Curl your right fingers from the current vector to the magnetic
field vector and your right thumb points down. Thus, the force on the top segment is downward, which produces no torque on
the shaft. Repeating this analysis for the bottom segment—neglect the small gap where the lead wires go out—shows that the
force on the bottom segment is upward, again producing no torque on the shaft.
Consider now the left vertical segment of the loop. Again using the right-hand rule, we find that the force exerted on this
segment is perpendicular to the magnetic field, as shown in Figure 20.23. This force produces a torque on the shaft. Repeating
this analysis on the right vertical segment of the loop shows that the force on this segment is in the direction opposite that of the
force on the left segment, thereby producing an equal torque on the shaft. The total torque on the shaft is thus twice the toque
on one of the vertical segments of the loop.
To find the magnitude of the torque as the wire loop spins, consider Figure 20.24, which shows a view of the wire loop from
above. Recall that torque is defined as
where F is the applied force, r is the distance from the pivot to where the
force is applied, and θ is the angle between r and F. Notice that, as the loop spins, the current in the vertical loop segments is
always perpendicular to the magnetic field. Thus, the equation
gives the magnitude of the force on each vertical
segment as
The distance r from the shaft to where this force is applied is w/2, so the torque created by this force is
20.10
Because there are two vertical segments, the total torque is twice this, or
20.11
If we have a multiple loop with N turns, we get N times the torque of a single loop. Using the fact that the area of the loop is
the expression for the torque becomes

This is the torque on a current-carrying loop in a uniform magnetic field. This equation can be shown to be valid for a loop of any
shape.

As the wire loop rotates, the torque increases to
when
The torque then decreases back to zero as the wire loop rotates to
the torque is negative. Thus, the torque changes sign every half turn, so the wire loop

For the coil to continue rotating in the same direction, the current is reversed as the coil passes through
using automatic switches called brushes, as shown in Figure 20.25.

clockwise. (b) The coil rotates continuously in the clockwise direction, with the current reversing each half revolution to maintain the

Consider now what happens if we run the motor in reverse; that is, we attach a handle to the shaft and mechanically force the
coil to rotate within the magnetic field, as shown in Figure 20.26. As per the equation

in the wires of the loop experience a magnetic force because they are moving in a

magnetic field. Again using the right-hand rule, where we curl our fingers from vector to vector , we find that charges in
the top and bottom segments feel a force perpendicular to the wire, which does not cause a current. However, charges in the
vertical wires experience forces parallel to the wire, causing a current to flow through the wire and through an external circuit if
one is connected. A device such as this that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy is called a generator.

Figure 20.26 When this coil is rotated through one-fourth of a revolution, the magnetic flux Φ changes from its maximum to zero, inducing
an emf, which drives a current through an external circuit.

Because current is induced only in the side wires, we can find the induced emf by only considering these wires. As explained in
Induced Current in a Wire, motional emf in a straight wire moving at velocity v through a magnetic field B is

Also, other factors prevent various different types of light bulbs from switching on and off so fast, so the light output is

In real life, electric generators look a lot different than the figures in this section, but the principles are the same. The source of
mechanical energy that turns the coil can be falling water—hydropower—steam produced by the burning of fossil fuels, or the
kinetic energy of wind. Figure 20.29 shows a cutaway view of a steam turbine; steam moves over the blades connected to the
shaft, which rotates the coil within the generator.

Another very useful and common device that exploits magnetic induction is called a transformer. Transformers do what their
name implies—they transform voltages from one value to another; the term voltage is used rather than emf because
transformers have internal resistance. For example, many cell phones, laptops, video games, power tools, and small appliances
have a transformer built into their plug-in unit that changes 120 V or 240 V AC into whatever voltage the device uses. Figure
20.30 shows two different transformers. Notice the wire coils that are visible in each device. The purpose of these coils is
explained below.

Figure 20.30 On the left is a common laminated-core transformer, which is widely used in electric power transmission and electrical
appliances. On the right is a toroidal transformer, which is smaller than the laminated-core transformer for the same power rating but is
more expensive to make because of the equipment required to wind the wires in the doughnut shape.

Figure 20.31 shows a laminated-coil transformer, which is based on Faraday’s law of induction and is very similar in
construction to the apparatus Faraday used to demonstrate that magnetic fields can generate electric currents. The two wire
coils are called the primary and secondary coils. In normal use, the input voltage is applied across the primary coil, and the
secondary produces the transformed output voltage. Not only does the iron core trap the magnetic field created by the primary
coil, but also its magnetization increases the field strength, which is analogous to how a dielectric increases the electric field
strength in a capacitor. Since the input voltage is AC, a time-varying magnetic flux is sent through the secondary coil, inducing
an AC output voltage.

Chapter 20 • Magnetism

Figure 20.31 A typical construction of a simple transformer has two coils wound on a ferromagnetic core. The magnetic field created by the
primary coil is mostly confined to and increased by the core, which transmits it to the secondary coil. Any change in current in the primary
coil induces a current in the secondary coil.

Magnetic Rope Memory

To send men to the moon, the Apollo program had to design an onboard computer system that would be robust, consume little
power, and be small enough to fit onboard the spacecraft. In the 1960s, when the Apollo program was launched, entire buildings
were regularly dedicated to housing computers whose computing power would be easily outstripped by today’s most basic
handheld calculator.
To address this problem, engineers at MIT and a major defense contractor turned to magnetic rope memory, which was an
offshoot of a similar technology used prior to that time for creating random access memories. Unlike random access memory,
magnetic rope memory was read-only memory that contained not only data but instructions as well. Thus, it was actually more
than memory: It was a hard-wired computer program.
The components of magnetic rope memory were wires and iron rings—which were called cores. The iron cores served as
transformers, such as that shown in the previous figure. However, instead of looping the wires multiple times around the core,
individual wires passed only a single time through the cores, making these single-turn transformers. Up to 63 word wires could
pass through a single core, along with a single bit wire. If a word wire passed through a given core, a voltage pulse on this wire
would induce an emf in the bit wire, which would be interpreted as a one. If the word wire did not pass through the core, no emf
would be induced on the bit wire, which would be interpreted as a zero.
Engineers would create programs that would be hard wired into these magnetic rope memories. The wiring process could take
as long as a month to complete as workers painstakingly threaded wires through some cores and around others. If any mistakes
were made either in the programming or the wiring, debugging would be extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible.
These modules did their job quite well. They are credited with correcting an astronaut mistake in the lunar landing procedure,
thereby allowing Apollo 11 to land on the moon. It is doubtful that Michael Faraday ever imagined such an application for
magnetic induction when he discovered it.
GRASP CHECK
If the bit wire were looped twice around each core, how would the voltage induced in the bit wire be affected?
a. If number of loops around the wire is doubled, the emf is halved.
b. If number of loops around the wire is doubled, the emf is not affected.
c. If number of loops around the wire is doubled, the emf is also doubled.
d. If number of loops around the wire is doubled, the emf is four times the initial value.

For the transformer shown in Figure 20.31, the output voltage
from the secondary coil depends almost entirely on the input
voltage
across the primary coil and the number of loops in the primary and secondary coils. Faraday’s law of induction for
the secondary coil gives its induced output voltage

is the rate of change of magnetic flux. The output voltage

is the same on each side. The

20.20
Taking the ratio of these last two equations yields the useful relationship
20.21
This is known as the transformer equation. It simply states that the ratio of the secondary voltage to the primary voltage in a
transformer equals the ratio of the number of loops in secondary coil to the number of loops in the primary coil.

Transmission of Electrical Power
Transformers are widely used in the electric power industry to increase voltages—called step-up transformers—before longdistance transmission via high-voltage wires. They are also used to decrease voltages—called step-down transformers—to
deliver power to homes and businesses. The overwhelming majority of electric power is generated by using magnetic induction,
whereby a wire coil or copper disk is rotated in a magnetic field. The primary energy required to rotate the coils or disk can be
provided by a variety of means. Hydroelectric power plants use the kinetic energy of water to drive electric generators. Coal or
nuclear power plants create steam to drive steam turbines that turn the coils. Other sources of primary energy include wind,
tides, or waves on water.
Once power is generated, it must be transmitted to the consumer, which often means transmitting power over hundreds of
kilometers. To do this, the voltage of the power plant is increased by a step-up transformer, that is stepped up, and the current
decreases proportionally because

of the transmission wires. The power lost to the
environment through this heat is

which is proportional to the current squared in the transmission wire. This is why the transmitted current

Voltages ranging from 120 to 700 kV are used for transmitting power over long distances. The voltage is stepped up at the exit of
the power station by a step-up transformer, as shown in Figure 20.32.

Figure 20.32 Transformers change voltages at several points in a power distribution system. Electric power is usually generated at greater
than 10 kV, and transmitted long distances at voltages ranging from 120 kV to 700 kV to limit energy losses. Local power distribution to
neighborhoods or industries goes through a substation and is sent short distances at voltages ranging from 5 to 13 kV. This is reduced to
120, 240, or 480 V for safety at the individual user site.

Once the power has arrived at a population or industrial center, the voltage is stepped down at a substation to between 5 and 30

kV. Finally, at individual homes or businesses, the power is stepped down again to 120, 240, or 480 V. Each step-up and stepdown transformation is done with a transformer designed based on Faradays law of induction. We’ve come a long way since
Queen Elizabeth asked Faraday what possible use could be made of electricity.

Changing Magnetic Fields
In the preceding section, we learned that a current creates a magnetic field. If nature is symmetrical, then perhaps a magnetic
field can create a current. In 1831, some 12 years after the discovery that an electric current generates a magnetic field, English
scientist Michael Faraday (1791–1862) and American scientist Joseph Henry (1797–1878) independently demonstrated that
magnetic fields can produce currents. The basic process of generating currents with magnetic fields is called induction; this
process is also called magnetic induction to distinguish it from charging by induction, which uses the electrostatic Coulomb
force.
When Faraday discovered what is now called Faraday’s law of induction, Queen Victoria asked him what possible use was
electricity. “Madam,” he replied, “What good is a baby?” Today, currents induced by magnetic fields are essential to our
technological society. The electric generator—found in everything from automobiles to bicycles to nuclear power plants—uses
magnetism to generate electric current. Other devices that use magnetism to induce currents include pickup coils in electric
guitars, transformers of every size, certain microphones, airport security gates, and damping mechanisms on sensitive
chemical balances.

20.3 • Electromagnetic Induction

One experiment Faraday did to demonstrate magnetic induction was to move a bar magnet through a wire coil and measure the
resulting electric current through the wire. A schematic of this experiment is shown in Figure 20.33. He found that current is
induced only when the magnet moves with respect to the coil. When the magnet is motionless with respect to the coil, no
current is induced in the coil, as in Figure 20.33. In addition, moving the magnet in the opposite direction (compare Figure
20.33 with Figure 20.33) or reversing the poles of the magnet (compare Figure 20.33 with Figure 20.33) results in a current in the
opposite direction.

Figure 20.33 Movement of a magnet relative to a coil produces electric currents as shown. The same currents are produced if the coil is
moved relative to the magnet. The greater the speed, the greater the magnitude of the current, and the current is zero when there is no
motion. The current produced by moving the magnet upward is in the opposite direction as the current produced by moving the magnet
downward.

Try this simulation to see how moving a magnet creates a current in a circuit. A light bulb lights up to show when current is
flowing, and a voltmeter shows the voltage drop across the light bulb. Try moving the magnet through a four-turn coil and
through a two-turn coil. For the same magnet speed, which coil produces a higher voltage?

GRASP CHECK
With the north pole to the left and moving the magnet from right to left, a positive voltage is produced as the magnet
enters the coil. What sign voltage will be produced if the experiment is repeated with the south pole to the left?
a. The sign of voltage will change because the direction of current flow will change by moving south pole of the magnet
to the left.
b. The sign of voltage will remain same because the direction of current flow will not change by moving south pole of
the magnet to the left.
c. The sign of voltage will change because the magnitude of current flow will change by moving south pole of the
magnet to the left.
d. The sign of voltage will remain same because the magnitude of current flow will not change by moving south pole of
the magnet to the left.

Induced Electromotive Force
If a current is induced in the coil, Faraday reasoned that there must be what he called an electromotive force pushing the
charges through the coil. This interpretation turned out to be incorrect; instead, the external source doing the work of moving
the magnet adds energy to the charges in the coil. The energy added per unit charge has units of volts, so the electromotive force
is actually a potential. Unfortunately, the name electromotive force stuck and with it the potential for confusing it with a real
force. For this reason, we avoid the term electromotive force and just use the abbreviation emf, which has the mathematical
symbol The emf may be defined as the rate at which energy is drawn from a source per unit current flowing through a circuit.
Thus, emf is the energy per unit charge added by a source, which contrasts with voltage, which is the energy per unit charge

released as the charges flow through a circuit.
To understand why an emf is generated in a coil due to a moving magnet, consider Figure 20.34, which shows a bar magnet
moving downward with respect to a wire loop. Initially, seven magnetic field lines are going through the loop (see left-hand
image). Because the magnet is moving away from the coil, only five magnetic field lines are going through the loop after a short
time
(see right-hand image). Thus, when a change occurs in the number of magnetic field lines going through the area
defined by the wire loop, an emf is induced in the wire loop. Experiments such as this show that the induced emf is proportional
to the rate of change of the magnetic field. Mathematically, we express this as
20.24
where

is the change in the magnitude in the magnetic field during time

and A is the area of the loop.

Figure 20.34 The bar magnet moves downward with respect to the wire loop, so that the number of magnetic field lines going through the
loop decreases with time. This causes an emf to be induced in the loop, creating an electric current.

Note that magnetic field lines that lie in the plane of the wire loop do not actually pass through the loop, as shown by the leftmost loop in Figure 20.35. In this figure, the arrow coming out of the loop is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the loop
and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. In Figure 20.35, as the loop is rotated from
to
the contribution of the magnetic field lines to the emf increases. Thus, what is important in generating an emf in the wire loop is
the component of the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, which is
This is analogous to a sail in the wind. Think of the conducting loop as the sail and the magnetic field as the wind. To maximize
the force of the wind on the sail, the sail is oriented so that its surface vector points in the same direction as the winds, as in the
right-most loop in Figure 20.35. When the sail is aligned so that its surface vector is perpendicular to the wind, as in the leftmost loop in Figure 20.35, then the wind exerts no force on the sail.
Thus, taking into account the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the area, the proportionality

becomes
20.25

Figure 20.35 The magnetic field lies in the plane of the left-most loop, so it cannot generate an emf in this case. When the loop is rotated so
that the angle of the magnetic field with the vector perpendicular to the area of the loop increases to

(see right-most loop), the

magnetic field contributes maximally to the emf in the loop. The dots show where the magnetic field lines intersect the plane defined by the

Another way to reduce the number of magnetic field lines that go through the conducting loop in Figure 20.35 is not to move the
magnet but to make the loop smaller. Experiments show that changing the area of a conducting loop in a stable magnetic field
induces an emf in the loop. Thus, the emf produced in a conducting loop is proportional to the rate of change of the product of
the perpendicular magnetic field and the loop area
20.26
where
is the perpendicular magnetic field and A is the area of the loop. The product
is very important. It is
proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass perpendicularly through a surface of area A. Going back to our sail
analogy, it would be proportional to the force of the wind on the sail. It is called the magnetic flux and is represented by .
20.27
The unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb), which is magnetic field per unit area, or T/m2. The weber is also a volt second (Vs).
The induced emf is in fact proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through a conducting loop.
20.28
Finally, for a coil made from N loops, the emf is N times stronger than for a single loop. Thus, the emf induced by a changing
magnetic field in a coil of N loops is

The last question to answer before we can change the proportionality into an equation is “In what direction does the current
flow?” The Russian scientist Heinrich Lenz (1804–1865) explained that the current flows in the direction that creates a magnetic
field that tries to keep the flux constant in the loop. For example, consider again Figure 20.34. The motion of the bar magnet
causes the number of upward-pointing magnetic field lines that go through the loop to decrease. Therefore, an emf is generated
in the loop that drives a current in the direction that creates more upward-pointing magnetic field lines. By using the righthand rule, we see that this current must flow in the direction shown in the figure. To express the fact that the induced emf acts
to counter the change in the magnetic flux through a wire loop, a minus sign is introduced into the proportionality
, which gives Faraday’s law of induction.
20.29
Lenz’s law is very important. To better understand it, consider Figure 20.36, which shows a magnet moving with respect to a
wire coil and the direction of the resulting current in the coil. In the top row, the north pole of the magnet approaches the coil,
pointing to the
so the magnetic field lines from the magnet point toward the coil. Thus, the magnetic field
right increases in the coil. According to Lenz’s law, the emf produced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a
magnetic field

inside the coil pointing to the left. This will counter the increase in magnetic flux pointing to

the right. To see which way the current must flow, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the magnetic field
and the current will flow in the direction indicated by curling your right fingers. This is shown by the image of the right hand in
the top row of Figure 20.36. Thus, the current must flow in the direction shown in Figure 4(a).
In Figure 4(b), the direction in which the magnet moves is reversed. In the coil, the right-pointing magnetic field
due to
the moving magnet decreases. Lenz’s law says that, to counter this decrease, the emf will drive a current that creates an
additional right-pointing magnetic field
in the coil. Again, point your right thumb in the desired direction of the
magnetic field, and the current will flow in the direction indicate by curling your right fingers (Figure 4(b)).
Finally, in Figure 4(c), the magnet is reversed so that the south pole is nearest the coil. Now the magnetic field
points
toward the magnet instead of toward the coil. As the magnet approaches the coil, it causes the left-pointing magnetic field in the
coil to increase. Lenz’s law tells us that the emf induced in the coil will drive a current in the direction that creates a magnetic
field pointing to the right. This will counter the increasing magnetic flux pointing to the left due to the magnet. Using the righthand rule again, as indicated in the figure, shows that the current must flow in the direction shown in Figure 4(c).

Chapter 20 • Magnetism

Figure 20.36 Lenz’s law tells us that the magnetically induced emf will drive a current that resists the change in the magnetic flux through a
circuit. This is shown in panels (a)–(c) for various magnet orientations and velocities. The right hands at right show how to apply the righthand rule to find in which direction the induced current flows around the coil.

20.33

Lenz’s law tells us that the current must produce a magnetic field to the right. Thus, we point our right thumb to the right and
curl our right fingers around the solenoid. The current must flow in the direction in which our fingers are pointing, so it enters
at the left end of the solenoid and exits at the right end.
Discussion
Let’s see if the minus sign makes sense in Faraday’s law of induction. Define the direction of the magnetic field to be the positive
direction. This means the change in the magnetic field is negative, as we found above. The minus sign in Faraday’s law of
induction negates the negative change in the magnetic field, leaving us with a positive current. Therefore, the current must flow
in the direction of the magnetic field, which is what we found.
Now try defining the positive direction to be the direction opposite that of the magnetic field, that is positive is to the left in
Figure 20.37. In this case, you will find a negative current. But since the positive direction is to the left, a negative current must
flow to the right, which again agrees with what we found by using Lenz’s law.

A slider circuit. The magnetic field is constant and the rod is pulled to the right at speed v. The changing area enclosed by

the circuit induces an emf in the circuit.

STRATEGY
We again use Faraday’s law of induction,

although this time the magnetic field is constant and the area enclosed

by the circuit changes. The circuit contains a single loop, so

The rate of change of the area is

Thus the rate of

change of the magnetic flux is
20.34
where we have used the fact that the angle between the area vector and the magnetic field is 0°. Once we know the emf, we can
find the current by using Ohm’s law. To find the direction of the current, we apply Lenz’s law.
Solution
Faraday’s law of induction gives
20.35
Solving Ohm’s law for the current and using the previous result for emf gives
20.36
As the rod slides to the right, the magnetic flux passing through the circuit increases. Lenz’s law tells us that the current induced
will create a magnetic field that will counter this increase. Thus, the magnetic field created by the induced current must be into
the page. Curling your right-hand fingers around the loop in the clockwise direction makes your right thumb point into the
page, which is the desired direction of the magnetic field. Thus, the current must flow in the clockwise direction around the
circuit.
Discussion
Is energy conserved in this circuit? An external agent must pull on the rod with sufficient force to just balance the force on a
current-carrying wire in a magnetic field—recall that
The rate at which this force does work on the rod should
be balanced by the rate at which the circuit dissipates power. Using
the force required to pull the wire at a
constant speed v is

SECTION SUMMARY
20.1 Magnetic Fields, Field Lines,
and Force
• All magnets have two poles: a north pole and a south
pole. If the magnet is free to move, its north pole orients
itself toward the geographic North Pole of Earth, and
the south pole orients itself toward the geographic
South Pole of Earth.
• A repulsive force occurs between the north poles of two
magnets and likewise for two south poles. However, an
attractive force occurs between the north pole of one
magnet and the south pole of another magnet.
• A charged particle moving through a magnetic field
experiences a force whose direction is determined by
the right-hand rule.
• An electric current generates a magnetic field.
• Electromagnets are magnets made by passing a current
through a system of wires.

20.2 Motors, Generators, and
Transformers
• Electric motors contain wire loops in a magnetic field.
Current is passed through the wire loops, which forces
them to rotate in the magnetic field. The current is
reversed every half rotation so that the torque on the
loop is always in the same direction.

• Electric generators contain wire loops in a magnetic
field. An external agent provides mechanical energy to
force the loops to rotate in the magnetic field, which
produces an AC voltage that drives an AC current
through the loops.
• Transformers contain a ring made of magnetic material
and, on opposite sides of the ring, two windings of wire
wrap around the ring. A changing current in one wire
winding creates a changing magnetic field, which is
trapped in the ring and thus goes through the second
winding and induces an emf in the second winding. The
voltage in the second winding is proportional to the
ratio of the number of loops in each winding.
• Transformers are used to step up and step down the
voltage for power transmission.
• Over long distances, electric power is transmitted at
high voltage to minimize the current and thereby
minimize the Joule losses due to resistive heating.

20.3 Electromagnetic Induction
• Faraday’s law of induction states that a changing
magnetic flux that occurs within an area enclosed by a
conducting loop induces an electric current in the loop.
• Lenz’ law states that an induced current flows in the
direction such that it opposes the change that induced
it.

21.3 The Dual Nature of Light

INTRODUCTION At first glance, the quantum nature of light can be a strange and bewildering concept. Between light acting as
discrete chunks, massless particles providing momenta, and fundamental particles behaving like waves, it may often seem like
something out of Alice in Wonderland.
For many, the study of this branch of physics can be as enthralling as Lewis Carroll’s classic novel. Recalling the works of
legendary characters and brilliant scientists such as Einstein, Planck, and Compton, the study of light’s quantum nature will
provide you an interesting tale of how a clever interpretation of some small details led to the most important discoveries of the
past 150 years. From the electronics revolution of the twentieth century to our future progress in solar energy and space
exploration, the quantum nature of light should yield a rabbit hole of curious consequence, within which lie some of the most
fascinating truths of our time.

Blackbodies
Our first story of curious significance begins with a T-shirt. You are likely aware that wearing a tight black T-shirt outside on a
hot day provides a significantly less comfortable experience than wearing a white shirt. Black shirts, as well as all other black
objects, will absorb and re-emit a significantly greater amount of radiation from the sun. This shirt is a good approximation of
what is called a blackbody.
A perfect blackbody is one that absorbs and re-emits all radiated energy that is incident upon it. Imagine wearing a tight shirt
that did this! This phenomenon is often modeled with quite a different scenario. Imagine carving a small hole in an oven that
can be heated to very high temperatures. As the temperature of this container gets hotter and hotter, the radiation out of this
dark hole would increase as well, re-emitting all energy provided it by the increased temperature. The hole may even begin to
glow in different colors as the temperature is increased. Like a burner on your stove, the hole would glow red, then orange, then
blue, as the temperature is increased. In time, the hole would continue to glow but the light would be invisible to our eyes. This
container is a good model of a perfect blackbody.
It is the analysis of blackbodies that led to one of the most consequential discoveries of the twentieth century. Take a moment to
carefully examine Figure 21.2. What relationships exist? What trends can you see? The more time you spend interpreting this
figure, the closer you will be to understanding quantum physics!

Figure 21.2 Graphs of blackbody radiation (from an ideal radiator) at three different radiator temperatures. The intensity or rate of radiation
emission increases dramatically with temperature, and the peak of the spectrum shifts toward the visible and ultraviolet parts of the
spectrum. The shape of the spectrum cannot be described with classical physics.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
When encountering a new graph, it is best to try to interpret the graph before you read about it. Doing this will make the
following text more meaningful and will help to remind yourself of some of the key concepts within the section.

Access for free at openstax.org.

21.1 • Planck and Quantum Nature of Light

Understanding Blackbody Graphs
Figure 21.2 is a plot of radiation intensity against radiated wavelength. In other words, it shows how the intensity of radiated
light changes when a blackbody is heated to a particular temperature.
It may help to just follow the bottom-most red line labeled 3,000 K, red hot. The graph shows that when a blackbody acquires a
temperature of 3,000 K, it radiates energy across the electromagnetic spectrum. However, the energy is most intensely emitted
at a wavelength of approximately 1000 nm. This is in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. While a body at this
temperature would appear red-hot to our eyes, it would truly appear ‘infrared-hot’ if we were able to see the entire spectrum.
A few other important notes regarding Figure 21.2:
• As temperature increases, the total amount of energy radiated increases. This is shown by examining the area underneath
each line.
• Regardless of temperature, all red lines on the graph undergo a consistent pattern. While electromagnetic radiation is
emitted throughout the spectrum, the intensity of this radiation peaks at one particular wavelength.
• As the temperature changes, the wavelength of greatest radiation intensity changes. At 4,000 K, the radiation is most
intense in the yellow-green portion of the spectrum. At 6,000 K, the blackbody would radiate white hot, due to intense
radiation throughout the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Remember that white light is the emission of all
visible colors simultaneously.
• As the temperature increases, the frequency of light providing the greatest intensity increases as well. Recall the equation
Because the speed of light is constant, frequency and wavelength are inversely related. This is verified by the
leftward movement of the three red lines as temperature is increased.
While in science it is important to categorize observations, theorizing as to why the observations exist is crucial to scientific
advancement. Why doesn’t a blackbody emit radiation evenly across all wavelengths? Why does the temperature of the body
change the peak wavelength that is radiated? Why does an increase in temperature cause the peak wavelength emitted to
decrease? It is questions like these that drove significant research at the turn of the twentieth century. And within the context of
these questions, Max Planck discovered something of tremendous importance.

Planck’s Revolution
The prevailing theory at the time of Max Planck’s discovery was that intensity and frequency were related by the equation
This equation, derived from classical physics and using wave phenomena, infers that as wavelength increases, the
intensity of energy provided will decrease with an inverse-squared relationship. This relationship is graphed in Figure 21.3 and
shows a troubling trend. For starters, it should be apparent that the graph from this equation does not match the blackbody
graphs found experimentally. Additionally, it shows that for an object of any temperature, there should be an infinite amount of
energy quickly emitted in the shortest wavelengths. When theory and experimental results clash, it is important to re-evaluate
both models. The disconnect between theory and reality was termed the ultraviolet catastrophe.

693

694

Chapter 21 • The Quantum Nature of Light

Figure 21.3 The graph above shows the true spectral measurements by a blackbody against those predicted by the classical theory at the
time. The discord between the predicted classical theory line and the actual results is known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.

Due to concerns over the ultraviolet catastrophe, Max Planck began to question whether another factor impacted the
relationship between intensity and wavelength. This factor, he posited, should affect the probability that short wavelength light
would be emitted. Should this factor reduce the probability of short wavelength light, it would cause the radiance curve to not
progress infinitely as in the classical theory, but would instead cause the curve to precipitate back downward as is shown in the
5,000 K, 4,000 K, and 3,000 K temperature lines of the graph in Figure 21.3. Planck noted that this factor, whatever it may be,
must also be dependent on temperature, as the intensity decreases at lower and lower wavelengths as the temperature
increases.
The determination of this probability factor was a groundbreaking discovery in physics, yielding insight not just into light but
also into energy and matter itself. It would be the basis for Planck’s 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics and would result in the transition
of physics from classical to modern understanding. In an attempt to determine the cause of the probability factor, Max Planck
constructed a new theory. This theory, which created the branch of physics called quantum mechanics, speculated that the
energy radiated by the blackbody could exist only in specific numerical, or quantum, states. This theory is described by the
equation
where n is any nonnegative integer (0, 1, 2, 3, …) and h is Planck’s constant, given by
and f is frequency.
Through this equation, Planck’s probability factor can be more clearly understood. Each frequency of light provides a specific
quantized amount of energy. Low frequency light, associated with longer wavelengths would provide a smaller amount of
energy, while high frequency light, associated with shorter wavelengths, would provide a larger amount of energy. For specified
temperatures with specific total energies, it makes sense that more low frequency light would be radiated than high frequency
light. To a degree, the relationship is like pouring coins through a funnel. More of the smaller pennies would be able to pass
through the funnel than the larger quarters. In other words, because the value of the coin is somewhat related to the size of the
coin, the probability of a quarter passing through the funnel is reduced!
Furthermore, an increase in temperature would signify the presence of higher energy. As a result, the greater amount of total
blackbody energy would allow for more of the high frequency, short wavelength, energies to be radiated. This permits the peak
of the blackbody curve to drift leftward as the temperature increases, as it does from the 3,000 K to 4,000 K to 5,000 K values.
Furthering our coin analogy, consider a wider funnel. This funnel would permit more quarters to pass through and allow for a
reduction in concern about the probability factor.
In summary, it is the interplay between the predicted classical model and the quantum probability that creates the curve
depicted in Figure 21.3. Just as quarters have a higher currency denomination than pennies, higher frequencies come with larger

21.1 • Planck and Quantum Nature of Light

amounts of energy. However, just as the probability of a quarter passing through a fixed diameter funnel is reduced, so is the
probability of a high frequency light existing in a fixed temperature object. As is often the case in physics, it is the balancing of
multiple incredible ideas that finally allows for better understanding.

Quantization
It may be helpful at this point to further consider the idea of quantum states. Atoms, molecules, and fundamental electron and
proton charges are all examples of physical entities that are quantized—that is, they appear only in certain discrete values and
do not have every conceivable value. On the macroscopic scale, this is not a revolutionary concept. A standing wave on a string
allows only particular harmonics described by integers. Going up and down a hill using discrete stair steps causes your potential
energy to take on discrete values as you move from step to step. Furthermore, we cannot have a fraction of an atom, or part of an
electron’s charge, or 14.33 cents. Rather, everything is built of integral multiples of these substructures.
That said, to discover quantum states within a phenomenon that science had always considered continuous would certainly be
surprising. When Max Planck was able to use quantization to correctly describe the experimentally known shape of the
blackbody spectrum, it was the first indication that energy was quantized on a small scale as well. This discovery earned Planck
the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 and was such a revolutionary departure from classical physics that Planck himself was
reluctant to accept his own idea. The general acceptance of Planck’s energy quantization was greatly enhanced by Einstein’s
explanation of the photoelectric effect (discussed in the next section), which took energy quantization a step further.

Figure 21.4 The German physicist Max Planck had a major influence on the early development of quantum mechanics, being the first to
recognize that energy is sometimes quantized. Planck also made important contributions to special relativity and classical physics. (credit:

WORKED EXAMPLE
How Many Photons per Second Does a Typical Light Bulb Produce?

Assuming that 10 percent of a 100-W light bulb’s energy output is in the visible range (typical for incandescent bulbs) with an
average wavelength of 580 nm, calculate the number of visible photons emitted per second.
Strategy
The number of visible photons per second is directly related to the amount of energy emitted each second, also known as the
bulb’s power. By determining the bulb’s power, the energy emitted each second can be found. Since the power is given in watts,
which is joules per second, the energy will be in joules. By comparing this to the amount of energy associated with each photon,
the number of photons emitted each second can be determined.
Solution
The power in visible light production is 10.0 percent of 100 W, or 10.0 J/s. The energy of the average visible photon is found by
substituting the given average wavelength into the formula

By rearranging the above formula to determine energy per photon, this produces
21.1
The number of visible photons per second is thus

Chapter 21 • The Quantum Nature of Light

Discussion
This incredible number of photons per second is verification that individual photons are insignificant in ordinary human
experience. However, it is also a verification of our everyday experience—on the macroscopic scale, photons are so small that
quantization becomes essentially continuous.

WORKED EXAMPLE
How does Photon Energy Change with Various Portions of the EM Spectrum?

Refer to the Graphs of Blackbody Radiation shown in the first figure in this section. Compare the energy necessary to radiate
one photon of infrared light and one photon of visible light.
Strategy
It is also necessary to find a representative
To determine the energy radiated, it is necessary to use the equation
frequency for infrared light and visible light.
Solution
According to the first figure in this section, one representative wavelength for infrared light is 2000 nm (2.000 × 10-6 m). The
associated frequency of an infrared light is
21.2
Using the equation

, the energy associated with one photon of representative infrared light is
21.3

The same process above can be used to determine the energy associated with one photon of representative visible light.
According to the first figure in this section, one representative wavelength for visible light is 500 nm.
21.4
21.5
Discussion
This example verifies that as the wavelength of light decreases, the quantum energy increases. This explains why a fire burning
with a blue flame is considered more dangerous than a fire with a red flame. Each photon of short-wavelength blue light emitted
carries a greater amount of energy than a long-wavelength red light. This example also helps explain the differences in the 3,000
K, 4,000 K, and 6,000 K lines shown in the first figure in this section. As the temperature is increased, more energy is available
for a greater number of short-wavelength photons to be emitted.

When light strikes certain materials, it can eject electrons from them. This is called the photoelectric effect, meaning that light
(photo) produces electricity. One common use of the photoelectric effect is in light meters, such as those that adjust the
automatic iris in various types of cameras. Another use is in solar cells, as you probably have in your calculator or have seen on a
rooftop or a roadside sign. These make use of the photoelectric effect to convert light into electricity for running different
devices.

Figure 21.5 The photoelectric effect can be observed by allowing light to fall on the metal plate in this evacuated tube. Electrons ejected by
the light are collected on the collector wire and measured as a current. A retarding voltage between the collector wire and plate can then be
adjusted so as to determine the energy of the ejected electrons. (credit: P. P. Urone)

Revolutionary Properties of the Photoelectric Effect
When Max Planck theorized that energy was quantized in a blackbody radiator, it is unlikely that he would have recognized just
how revolutionary his idea was. Using tools similar to the light meter in Figure 21.5, it would take a scientist of Albert Einstein’s
stature to fully discover the implications of Max Planck’s radical concept.
Through careful observations of the photoelectric effect, Albert Einstein realized that there were several characteristics that
could be explained only if EM radiation is itself quantized. While these characteristics will be explained a bit later in this
section, you can already begin to appreciate why Einstein’s idea is very important. It means that the apparently continuous
stream of energy in an EM wave is actually not a continuous stream at all. In fact, the EM wave itself is actually composed of tiny
quantum packets of energy called photons.
In equation form, Einstein found the energy of a photon or photoelectron to be

where E is the energy of a photon of frequency f and h is Planck’s constant. A beam from a flashlight, which to this point had
been considered a wave, instead could now be viewed as a series of photons, each providing a specific amount of energy see
Figure 21.6. Furthermore, the amount of energy within each individual photon is based upon its individual frequency, as

dictated by
As a result, the total amount of energy provided by the beam could now be viewed as the sum of all
frequency-dependent photon energies added together.

Figure 21.6 An EM wave of frequency f is composed of photons, or individual quanta of EM radiation. The energy of each photon is

,

where h is Planck’s constant and f is the frequency of the EM radiation. Higher intensity means more photons per unit area per second. The
flashlight emits large numbers of photons of many different frequencies, hence others have energy

, and so on.

Just as with Planck’s blackbody radiation, Einstein’s concept of the photon could take hold in the scientific community only if it
could succeed where classical physics failed. The photoelectric effect would be a key to demonstrating Einstein’s brilliance.
Consider the following five properties of the photoelectric effect. All of these properties are consistent with the idea that
individual photons of EM radiation are absorbed by individual electrons in a material, with the electron gaining the photon’s
energy. Some of these properties are inconsistent with the idea that EM radiation is a simple wave. For simplicity, let us
consider what happens with monochromatic EM radiation in which all photons have the same energy hf.

Figure 21.7 Incident radiation strikes a clean metal surface, ejecting multiple electrons from it. The manner in which the frequency and
intensity of the incoming radiation affect the ejected electrons strongly suggests that electromagnetic radiation is quantized. This event,
called the photoelectric effect, is strong evidence for the existence of photons.

1. If we vary the frequency of the EM radiation falling on a clean metal surface, we find the following: For a given material,
there is a threshold frequency f0 for the EM radiation below which no electrons are ejected, regardless of intensity. Using
the photon model, the explanation for this is clear. Individual photons interact with individual electrons. Thus if the energy
of an individual photon is too low to break an electron away, no electrons will be ejected. However, if EM radiation were a
simple wave, sufficient energy could be obtained simply by increasing the intensity.
2. Once EM radiation falls on a material, electrons are ejected without delay. As soon as an individual photon of sufficiently
high frequency is absorbed by an individual electron, the electron is ejected. If the EM radiation were a simple wave,
several minutes would be required for sufficient energy to be deposited at the metal surface in order to eject an electron.
3. The number of electrons ejected per unit time is proportional to the intensity of the EM radiation and to no other
characteristic. High-intensity EM radiation consists of large numbers of photons per unit area, with all photons having the
same characteristic energy, hf. The increased number of photons per unit area results in an increased number of electrons
per unit area ejected.
4. If we vary the intensity of the EM radiation and measure the energy of ejected electrons, we find the following: The
maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons is independent of the intensity of the EM radiation. Instead, as noted in point
3 above, increased intensity results in more electrons of the same energy being ejected. If EM radiation were a simple wave,
a higher intensity could transfer more energy, and higher-energy electrons would be ejected.
5. The kinetic energy KE of an ejected electron equals the photon energy minus the binding energy BE of the electron in the

specific material. An individual photon can give all of its energy to an electron. The photon’s energy is partly used to break
the electron away from the material. The remainder goes into the ejected electron’s kinetic energy. In equation form, this is
given by
21.6
where
is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electron, is the photon’s energy, and BE is the binding energy of the
electron to the particular material. This equation explains the properties of the photoelectric effect quantitatively and
demonstrates that BE is the minimum amount of energy necessary to eject an electron. If the energy supplied is less than BE,
the electron cannot be ejected. The binding energy can also be written as

particular material. Figure 21.8 shows a graph of maximum
particular material.

Figure 21.8 A graph of the kinetic energy of an ejected electron, KEe, versus the frequency of EM radiation impinging on a certain material.
There is a threshold frequency below which no electrons are ejected, because the individual photon interacting with an individual electron
has insufficient energy to break it away. Above the threshold energy, KEe increases linearly with f, consistent with KEe = hf − BE. The slope
of this line is h, so the data can be used to determine Planck’s constant experimentally.

Discussion
The energy of this 420 nm photon of violet light is a tiny fraction of a joule, and so it is no wonder that a single photon would be
difficult for us to sense directly—humans are more attuned to energies on the order of joules. But looking at the energy in
electron volts, we can see that this photon has enough energy to affect atoms and molecules. A DNA molecule can be broken with
about 1 eV of energy, for example, and typical atomic and molecular energies are on the order of eV, so that the photon in this
example could have biological effects, such as sunburn. The ejected electron has rather low energy, and it would not travel far,

except in a vacuum. The electron would be stopped by a retarding potential of only 0.26 eV, a slightly larger KE than calculated
above. In fact, if the photon wavelength were longer and its energy less than 2.71 eV, then the formula would give a negative
kinetic energy, an impossibility. This simply means that the 420 nm photons with their 2.96 eV energy are not much above the
frequency threshold. You can see for yourself that the threshold wavelength is 458 nm (blue light). This means that if calcium
metal were used in a light meter, the meter would be insensitive to wavelengths longer than those of blue light. Such a light
meter would be completely insensitive to red light, for example.

Technological Applications of the Photoelectric Effect
While Einstein’s understanding of the photoelectric effect was a transformative discovery in the early 1900s, its presence is
ubiquitous today. If you have watched streetlights turn on automatically in response to the setting sun, stopped elevator doors
from closing simply by putting your hands between them, or turned on a water faucet by sliding your hands near it, you are
familiar with the electric eye, a name given to a group of devices that use the photoelectric effect for detection.
All these devices rely on photoconductive cells. These cells are activated when light is absorbed by a semi-conductive material,
knocking off a free electron. When this happens, an electron void is left behind, which attracts a nearby electron. The movement
of this electron, and the resultant chain of electron movements, produces a current. If electron ejection continues, further holes
are created, thereby increasing the electrical conductivity of the cell. This current can turn switches on and off and activate
various familiar mechanisms.
One such mechanism takes place where you may not expect it. Next time you are at the movie theater, pay close attention to the
sound coming out of the speakers. This sound is actually created using the photoelectric effect! The audiotape in the projector
booth is a transparent piece of film of varying width. This film is fed between a photocell and a bright light produced by an
exciter lamp. As the transparent portion of the film varies in width, the amount of light that strikes the photocell varies as well.
As a result, the current in the photoconductive circuit changes with the width of the filmstrip. This changing current is
converted to a changing frequency, which creates the soundtrack commonly heard in the theater.

WORK IN PHYSICS
Solar Energy Physicist

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Earth receives enough sunlight each hour to power the entire globe for a year.
While converting all of this energy is impossible, the job of the solar energy physicist is to explore and improve upon solar
energy conversion technologies so that we may harness more of this abundant resource.
The field of solar energy is not a new one. For over half a century, satellites and spacecraft have utilized photovoltaic cells to
create current and power their operations. As time has gone on, scientists have worked to adapt this process so that it may be
used in homes, businesses, and full-scale power stations using solar cells like the one shown in Figure 21.9.

21.2 • Einstein and the Photoelectric Effect

Figure 21.9 A solar cell is an example of a photovoltaic cell. As light strikes the cell, the cell absorbs the energy of the photons. If this
energy exceeds the binding energy of the electrons, then electrons will be forced to move in the cell, thereby producing a current. This
current may be used for a variety of purposes. (credit: U.S. Department of Energy)

Solar energy is converted to electrical energy in one of two manners: direct transfer through photovoltaic cells or thermal
conversion through the use of a CSP, concentrating solar power, system. Unlike electric eyes, which trip a mechanism when
current is lost, photovoltaic cells utilize semiconductors to directly transfer the electrons released through the photoelectric
effect into a directed current. The energy from this current can then be converted for storage, or immediately used in an electric
process. A CSP system is an indirect method of energy conversion. In this process, light from the Sun is channeled using
parabolic mirrors. The light from these mirrors strikes a thermally conductive material, which then heats a pool of water. This
water, in turn, is converted to steam, which turns a turbine and creates electricity. While indirect, this method has long been the
traditional means of large-scale power generation.
There are, of course, limitations to the efficacy of solar power. Cloud cover, nightfall, and incident angle strike at high altitudes
are all factors that directly influence the amount of light energy available. Additionally, the creation of photovoltaic cells requires
rare-earth minerals that can be difficult to obtain. However, the major role of a solar energy physicist is to find ways to improve
the efficiency of the solar energy conversion process. Currently, this is done by experimenting with new semi conductive
materials, by refining current energy transfer methods, and by determining new ways of incorporating solar structures into the
current power grid.
Additionally, many solar physicists are looking into ways to allow for increased solar use in impoverished, more remote
locations. Because solar energy conversion does not require a connection to a large-scale power grid, research into thinner,
more mobile materials will permit remote cultures to use solar cells to convert sunlight collected during the day into stored
energy that can then be used at night.
Regardless of the application, solar energy physicists are an important part of the future in responsible energy growth. While a
doctoral degree is often necessary for advanced research applications, a bachelor's or master's degree in a related science or
engineering field is typically enough to gain access into the industry. Computer skills are very important for energy modeling,
including knowledge of CAD software for design purposes. In addition, the ability to collaborate and communicate with others
is critical to becoming a solar energy physicist.

electromagnetic radiation shared properties with our more macroscopic particles. This is no clearer than when considering the
photoelectric effect, where photons knock electrons out of a substance. While it is strange to think of a massless particle
exhibiting momentum, it is now a well-established fact within the scientific community. Figure 21.10 shows macroscopic
evidence of photon momentum.

Figure 21.10 The tails of the Hale-Bopp comet point away from the Sun, evidence that light has momentum. Dust emanating from the body
of the comet forms this tail. Particles of dust are pushed away from the Sun by light reflecting from them. The blue, ionized gas tail is also
produced by photons interacting with atoms in the comet material. (credit: Geoff Chester, U.S. Navy, via Wikimedia Commons)

Figure 21.10 shows a comet with two prominent tails. Comet tails are composed of gases and dust evaporated from the body of
the comet and ionized gas. What most people do not know about the tails is that they always point away from the Sun rather
than trailing behind the comet. This can be seen in the diagram.
Why would this be the case? The evidence indicates that the dust particles of the comet are forced away from the Sun when
photons strike them. Evidently, photons carry momentum in the direction of their motion away from the Sun, and some of this
momentum is transferred to dust particles in collisions. The blue tail is caused by the solar wind, a stream of plasma consisting
primarily of protons and electrons evaporating from the corona of the Sun.

Momentum, The Compton Effect, and Solar Sails
Momentum is conserved in quantum mechanics, just as it is in relativity and classical physics. Some of the earliest direct
experimental evidence of this came from the scattering of X-ray photons by electrons in substances, a phenomenon discovered
by American physicist Arthur H. Compton (1892–1962). Around 1923, Compton observed that X-rays reflecting from materials
had decreased energy and correctly interpreted this as being due to the scattering of the X-ray photons by electrons. This
phenomenon could be handled as a collision between two particles—a photon and an electron at rest in the material. After
careful observation, it was found that both energy and momentum were conserved in the collision. See Figure 21.11. For the
discovery of this conserved scattering, now known as the Compton effect, Arthur Compton was awarded the Nobel Prize in
1929.
Shortly after the discovery of Compton scattering, the value of the photon momentum,
was determined by Louis de Broglie. In this equation, called the de Broglie relation, h represents Planck’s constant and λ is the
photon wavelength.

Figure 21.11 The Compton effect is the name given to the scattering of a photon by an electron. Energy and momentum are conserved,
resulting in a reduction of both for the scattered photon.

Chapter 21 • The Quantum Nature of Light

We can see that photon momentum is small, since
and h is very small. It is for this reason that we do not ordinarily
observe photon momentum. Our mirrors do not recoil when light reflects from them, except perhaps in cartoons. Compton saw
the effects of photon momentum because he was observing X-rays, which have a small wavelength and a relatively large
momentum, interacting with the lightest of particles, the electron.

Discussion
Even in huge numbers, the total momentum that photons carry is small. An electron that carries the same momentum as a
500-nm photon will have a 1,460 m/s velocity, which is clearly nonrelativistic. This is borne out by the experimental observation
that it takes far less energy to give an electron the same momentum as a photon. That said, for high-energy photons interacting
with small masses, photon momentum may be significant. Even on a large scale, photon momentum can have an effect if there

are enough of them and if there is nothing to prevent the slow recoil of matter. Comet tails are one example, but there are also
proposals to build space sails that use huge low-mass mirrors (made of aluminized Mylar) to reflect sunlight. In the vacuum of
space, the mirrors would gradually recoil and could actually accelerate spacecraft within the solar system. See the following
figure.
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
When determining energies in particle physics, it is more sensible to use the unit eV instead of Joules. Using eV will help you
to recognize differences in magnitude more easily and will make calculations simpler. Also, eV is used by scientists to
describe the binding energy of particles and their rest mass, so using eV will eliminate the need to convert energy quantities.
Finally, eV is a convenient unit when linking electromagnetic forces to particle physics, as one eV is the amount energy given
to an electron when placed in a field of 1-V potential difference.

Traversing the Solar System using nothing but the Sun’s power has long been a fantasy of scientists and science fiction writers
alike. Though physicists like Compton, Einstein, and Planck all provided evidence of light’s propulsive capacity, it is only recently
that the technology has become available to truly put these visions into motion. In 2016, by sending a lightweight satellite into
space, the LightSail-1 project is designed to do just that.
A citizen-funded project headed by the Planetary Society, the 5.45-million-dollar LightSail-1 project is set to launch two crafts
into orbit around the Earth. Each craft is equipped with a 32-square-meter solar sail prepared to unfurl once a rocket has
launched it to an appropriate altitude. The sails are made of large mirrors, each a quarter of the thickness of a trash bag, which
will receive an impulse from the Sun’s reflecting photons. Each time the Sun’s photon strikes the craft’s reflective surface and
bounces off, it will provide a momentum to the sail much greater than if the photon were simply absorbed.
Attached to three tiny satellites called CubeSats, whose combined volume is no larger than a loaf of bread, the received
momentum from the Sun’s photons should be enough to record a substantial increase in orbital speed. The intent of the
LightSail-1 mission is to prove that the technology behind photon momentum travel is sound and can be done cheaply. A test
flight in May 2015 showed that the craft’s Mylar sails could unfurl on command. With another successful result in 2016, the
Planetary Society will be planning future versions of the craft with the hopes of eventually achieving interplanetary satellite
travel. Though a few centuries premature, Kepler’s fantastic vision may not be that far away.
If eventually set into interplanetary launch, what will be the effect of continual photon bombardment on the motion of a craft
similar to LightSail-1?
a. It will result in continual acceleration of the craft.
b. It will first accelerate and then decelerate the craft.
c. It will first decelerate and then accelerate the craft.
d. It will result in the craft moving at constant velocity.

Particle-Wave Duality
We have long known that EM radiation is like a wave, capable of interference and diffraction. We now see that light can also be
modeled as particles—massless photons of discrete energy and momentum. We call this twofold nature the particle-wave
duality, meaning that EM radiation has properties of both particles and waves. This may seem contradictory, since we ordinarily
deal with large objects that never act like both waves and particles. An ocean wave, for example, looks nothing like a grain of
sand. However, this so-called duality is simply a term for properties of the photon analogous to phenomena we can observe
directly, on a macroscopic scale. See Figure 21.14. If this term seems strange, it is because we do not ordinarily observe details on
the quantum level directly, and our observations yield either particle-like or wave-like properties, but never both
simultaneously.

Figure 21.14 (a) The interference pattern for light through a double slit is a wave property understood by analogy to water waves. (b) The
properties of photons having quantized energy and momentum and acting as a concentrated unit are understood by analogy to
macroscopic particles.

Since we have a particle-wave duality for photons, and since we have seen connections between photons and matter in that both
have momentum, it is reasonable to ask whether there is a particle-wave duality for matter as well. If the EM radiation we once
thought to be a pure wave has particle properties, is it possible that matter has wave properties? The answer, strangely, is yes.
The consequences of this are tremendous, as particle-wave duality has been a constant source of scientific wonder during the
twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

SECTION SUMMARY
21.1 Planck and Quantum Nature of
Light
• A blackbody will radiate energy across all wavelengths
of the electromagnetic spectrum.
• Radiation of a blackbody will peak at a particular
wavelength, dependent on the temperature of the
blackbody.
• Analysis of blackbody radiation led to the field of
quantum mechanics, which states that radiated energy
can only exist in discrete quantum states.

21.2 Einstein and the Photoelectric
Effect
• The photoelectric effect is the process in which EM
radiation ejects electrons from a material.
• Einstein proposed photons to be quanta of EM
radiation having energy
where f is the
frequency of the radiation.
• All EM radiation is composed of photons. As Einstein

explained, all characteristics of the photoelectric effect
are due to the interaction of individual photons with
individual electrons.
• The maximum kinetic energy KEe of ejected electrons
(photoelectrons) is given by
where hf
is the photon energy and BE is the binding energy (or
work function) of the electron in the particular
material.

21.3 The Dual Nature of Light
• Compton scattering provided evidence that photonelectron interactions abide by the principles of
conservation of momentum and conservation of energy.
• The momentum of individual photons, quantified by
, can be used to explain observations of comets
and may lead to future space technologies.
• Electromagnetic waves and matter have both wave-like
and particle-like properties. This phenomenon is
defined as particle-wave duality.

INTRODUCTION From childhood on, we learn that atoms are a substructure of all things around us, from the air we breathe to
the autumn leaves that blanket a forest trail. Invisible to the eye, the atoms have properties that are used to explain many
phenomena—a theme found throughout this text. In this chapter, we discuss the discovery of atoms and their own
substructures. We will then learn about the forces that keep them together and the tremendous energy they release when we
break them apart. Finally, we will see how the knowledge and manipulation of atoms allows us to better understand geology,
biology, and the world around us.

How do we know that atoms are really there if we cannot see them with our own eyes? While often taken for granted, our
knowledge of the existence and structure of atoms is the result of centuries of contemplation and experimentation. The earliest
known speculation on the atom dates back to the fifth century B.C., when Greek philosophers Leucippus and Democritus
contemplated whether a substance could be divided without limit into ever smaller pieces. Since then, scientists such as John
Dalton (1766–1844), Amadeo Avogadro (1776–1856), and Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) helped to discover the properties of that
fundamental structure of matter. While much could be written about any number of important scientific philosophers, this
section will focus on the role played by Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937). Though his understanding of our most elemental matter is
rooted in the success of countless prior investigations, his surprising discovery about the interior of the atom is most
fundamental in explaining so many well-known phenomena.

Rutherford’s Experiment
In the early 1900’s, the plum pudding model was the accepted model of the atom. Proposed in 1904 by J. J. Thomson, the model
suggested that the atom was a spherical ball of positive charge, with negatively charged electrons scattered evenly throughout.
In that model, the positive charges made up the pudding, while the electrons acted as isolated plums. During its short life, the
model could be used to explain why most particles were neutral, although with an unbalanced number of plums, electrically
charged atoms could exist.
When Ernest Rutherford began his gold foil experiment in 1909, it is unlikely that anyone would have expected that the plum
pudding model would be challenged. However, using a radioactive source, a thin sheet of gold foil, and a phosphorescent screen,
Rutherford would uncover something so great that he would later call it “the most incredible event that has ever happened to me
in my life”[James, L. K. (1993). Nobel Laureates in Chemistry, 1901–1992. Washington, DC: American Chemical Society.]
The experiment that Rutherford designed is shown in Figure 22.2. As you can see in, a radioactive source was placed in a lead
container with a hole in one side to produce a beam of positively charged helium particles, called alpha particles. Then, a thin
gold foil sheet was placed in the beam. When the high-energy alpha particles passed through the gold foil, they were scattered.
The scattering was observed from the bright spots they produced when they struck the phosphor screen.

Figure 22.2 Rutherford’s experiment gave direct evidence for the size and mass of the nucleus by scattering alpha particles from a thin gold
foil. The scattering of particles suggests that the gold nuclei are very small and contain nearly all of the gold atom’s mass. Particularly
significant in showing the size of the nucleus are alpha particles that scatter to very large angles, much like a soccer ball bouncing off a
goalie’s head.

The expectation of the plum pudding model was that the high-energy alpha particles would be scattered only slightly by the
presence of the gold sheet. Because the energy of the alpha particles was much higher than those typically associated with
atoms, the alpha particles should have passed through the thin foil much like a supersonic bowling ball would crash through a

22.1 • The Structure of the Atom

few dozen rows of bowling pins. Any deflection was expected to be minor, and due primarily to the electrostatic Coulomb force
between the alpha particles and the foil’s interior electric charges.
However, the true result was nothing of the sort. While the majority of alpha particles passed through the foil unobstructed,
Rutherford and his collaborators Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden found that alpha particles occasionally were scattered to
large angles, and some even came back in the direction from which they came! The result, called Rutherford scattering, implied
that the gold nuclei were actually very small when compared with the size of the gold atom. As shown in Figure 22.3, the dense
nucleus is surrounded by mostly empty space of the atom, an idea verified by the fact that only 1 in 8,000 particles was scattered
backward.

Figure 22.3 An expanded view of the atoms in the gold foil in Rutherford’s experiment. Circles represent the atoms that are about 10−10 m
in diameter, while the dots represent the nuclei that are about 10−15 m in diameter. To be visible, the dots are much larger than scale—if the
nuclei were actually the size of the dots, each atom would have a diameter of about five meters! Most alpha particles crash through but are
relatively unaffected because of their high energy and the electron’s small mass. Some, however, strike a nucleus and are scattered straight
back. A detailed analysis of their interaction gives the size and mass of the nucleus.

Although the results of the experiment were published by his colleagues in 1909, it took Rutherford two years to convince himself
of their meaning. Rutherford later wrote: “It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and
it came back and hit you. On consideration, I realized that this scattering backwards ... [meant] ... the greatest part of the mass
of the atom was concentrated in a tiny nucleus.” In 1911, Rutherford published his analysis together with a proposed model of the
atom, which was in part based on Geiger’s work from the previous year. As a result of the paper, the size of the nucleus was
determined to be about
m, or 100,000 times smaller than the atom. That implies a huge density, on the order of
g/
cm3, much greater than any macroscopic matter.
Based on the size and mass of the nucleus revealed by his experiment, as well as the mass of electrons, Rutherford proposed the
planetary model of the atom. The planetary model of the atom pictures low-mass electrons orbiting a large-mass nucleus. The
sizes of the electron orbits are large compared with the size of the nucleus, and most of the atom is a vacuum. The model is
analogous to how low-mass planets in our solar system orbit the large-mass Sun. In the atom, the attractive Coulomb force is
analogous to gravitation in the planetary system (see Figure 22.4).

Figure 22.4 Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom incorporates the characteristics of the nucleus, electrons, and the size of the atom.
The model was the first to recognize the structure of atoms, in which low-mass electrons orbit a very small, massive nucleus in orbits much
larger than the nucleus. The atom is mostly empty and is analogous to our planetary system.

How did Rutherford figure out the structure of the atom without being able to see it? Explore the answer through this
simulation of the famous experiment in which he disproved the plum pudding model by observing alpha particles bouncing
off atoms and determining that they must have a small core.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
As you progress through the model of the atom, consider the effect that experimentation has on the scientific process. Ask
yourself the following: What would our model of the atom be without Rutherford’s gold foil experiment? What further
understanding of the atom would not have been gained? How would that affect our current technologies? Though often
confusing, experiments taking place today to further understand composition of the atom could perhaps have a similar
effect.

Absorption and Emission Spectra
In 1900, Max Planck recognized that all energy radiated from a source is emitted by atoms in quantum states. How would that
radical idea relate to the interior of an atom? The answer was first found by investigating the spectrum of light or emission
spectrum produced when a gas is highly energized.
Figure 22.5 shows how to isolate the emission spectrum of one such gas. The gas is placed in the discharge tube at the left, where
it is energized to the point at which it begins to radiate energy or emit light. The radiated light is channeled by a thin slit and
then passed through a diffraction grating, which will separate the light into its constituent wavelengths. The separated light will
then strike the photographic film on the right.
The line spectrum shown in part (b) of Figure 22.5 is the output shown on the film for excited iron. Note that this spectrum is not
continuous but discrete. In other words, only particular wavelengths are emitted by the iron source. Why would that be the case?

Figure 22.5 Part (a) shows, from left to right, a discharge tube, slit, and diffraction grating producing a line spectrum. Part (b) shows the
emission spectrum for iron. The discrete lines imply quantized energy states for the atoms that produce them. The line spectrum for each
element is unique, providing a powerful and much-used analytical tool, and many line spectra were well known for many years before they
could be explained with physics. (credit:(b) Yttrium91, Wikimedia Commons)

The spectrum of light created by excited iron shows a variety of discrete wavelengths emitted within the visible spectrum. Each
element, when excited to the appropriate degree, will create a discrete emission spectrum as in part (b) of Figure 22.5. However,
the wavelengths emitted will vary from element to element. The emission spectrum for iron was chosen for Figure 22.5 solely

22.1 • The Structure of the Atom

because a substantial portion of its emission spectrum is within the visible spectrum. Figure 22.6 shows the emission spectrum
for hydrogen. Note that, while discrete, a large portion of hydrogen emission takes place in the ultraviolet and infrared regions.

Figure 22.6 A schematic of the hydrogen spectrum shows several series named for those who contributed most to their determination. Part
of the Balmer series is in the visible spectrum, while the Lyman series is entirely in the ultraviolet, and the Paschen series and others are in
the infrared. Values of nf and ni are shown for some of the lines. Their importance will be described shortly.

Just as an emission spectrum shows all discrete wavelengths emitted by a gas, an absorption spectrum will show all light that is
absorbed by a gas. Black lines exist where the wavelengths are absorbed, with the remainder of the spectrum lit by light is free to
pass through. What relationship do you think exists between the black lines of a gas’s absorption spectrum and the colored lines
of its emission spectrum? Figure 22.7 shows the absorption spectrum of the Sun. The black lines are called Fraunhofer lines,
and they correspond to the wavelengths absorbed by gases in the Sun’s exterior.

Figure 22.7 The absorption spectrum of the Sun. The black lines appear at wavelengths absorbed by the Sun’s gas exterior. The energetic
photons emitted from the Sun’s interior are absorbed by gas in its exterior and reemitted in directions away from the observer. That results
in dark lines within the absorption spectrum. The lines are called Fraunhofer lines, in honor of the German physicist who discovered them.
Lines similar to those are used to determine the chemical composition of stars well outside our solar system.

Bohr’s Explanation of the Hydrogen Spectrum
To tie the unique signatures of emission spectra to the composition of the atom itself would require clever thinking. Niels Bohr
(1885–1962), a Danish physicist, did just that, by making immediate use of Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom. Bohr,
shown in Figure 22.8, became convinced of its validity and spent part of 1912 at Rutherford’s laboratory. In 1913, after returning
to Copenhagen, he began publishing his theory of the simplest atom, hydrogen, based on Rutherford’s planetary model.

colleagues, and his personal integrity, especially in the face of Nazi oppression, earned him a prominent place in history. (credit: Unknown

Bohr was able to derive the formula for the hydrogen spectrum using basic physics, the planetary model of the atom, and some
very important new conjectures. His first conjecture was that only certain orbits are allowed: In other words, in an atom, the
orbits of electrons are quantized. Each quantized orbit has a different distinct energy, and electrons can move to a higher orbit
by absorbing energy or drop to a lower orbit by emitting energy. Because of the quantized orbits, the amount of energy emitted
or absorbed must also be quantized, producing the discrete spectra seen in Figure 22.5 and Figure 22.7. In equation form, the
amount of energy absorbed or emitted can be found as

wavelength emitted can be found using the equation

It makes sense that energy is involved in changing orbits. For example, a burst of energy is required for a satellite to climb to a
higher orbit. What is not expected is that atomic orbits should be quantized. Quantization is not observed for satellites or
planets, which can have any orbit, given the proper energy (see Figure 22.9).

Figure 22.9 The planetary model of the atom, as modified by Bohr, has the orbits of the electrons quantized. Only certain orbits are
allowed, explaining why atomic spectra are discrete or quantized. The energy carried away from an atom by a photon comes from the
electron dropping from one allowed orbit to another and is thus quantized. The same is true for atomic absorption of photons.

Figure 22.10 shows an energy-level diagram, a convenient way to display energy states. Each of the horizontal lines corresponds
to the energy of an electron in a different orbital. Energy is plotted vertically with the lowest or ground state at the bottom and
with excited states above. The vertical arrow downwards shows energy being emitted out of the atom due to an electron
dropping from one excited state to another. That would correspond to a line shown on the atom’s emission spectrum. The Lyman
series shown in Figure 22.6 results from electrons dropping to the ground state, while the Balmer and Paschen series result to
electrons dropping to the n = 2 and n = 3 states, respectively.

Energy and Wavelength of Emitted Hydrogen Spectra
The energy associated with a particular orbital of a hydrogen atom can be found using the equation
22.3
where n corresponds to the orbital value from the atom’s nucleus. The negative value in the equation is based upon a baseline
energy of zero when the electron is infinitely far from the atom. As a result, the negative value shows that energy is necessary to
free the electron from its orbital state. The minimum energy to free the electron is also referred to as its binding energy. The
equation is only valid for atoms with single electrons in their orbital shells (like hydrogen). For ionized atoms similar to
hydrogen, the following formula may be used.

studied. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus—it is different for each element. The above equation is
derived from some basic physics principles, namely conservation of energy, conservation of angular momentum, Coulomb’s law,
and centripetal force. There are three derivations that result in the orbital energy equations, and they are shown below. While
you can use the energy equations without understanding the derivations, they will help to remind you of just how valuable those
fundamental concepts are.

Derivation 1 (Finding the Radius of an Orbital)
One primary difference between the planetary model of the solar system and the planetary model of the atom is the cause of the
circular motion. While gravitation causes the motion of orbiting planets around an interior star, the Coulomb force is
responsible for the circular shape of the electron’s orbit. The magnitude of the centripetal force is
the Coulomb force is

, while the magnitude of

. The assumption here is that the nucleus is more massive than the stationary electron, and the

electron orbits about it. That is consistent with the planetary model of the atom. Equating the Coulomb force and the centripetal
force,

Derivation 2 (Finding the Velocity of the Orbiting Electron)
Bohr was clever enough to find a way to calculate the electron orbital energies in hydrogen. That was an important first step that
has been improved upon, but it is well worth repeating here, because it does correctly describe many characteristics of
hydrogen. Assuming circular orbits, Bohr proposed that the angular momentum L of an electron in its orbit is also quantized,
that is, it has only specific, discrete values. The value for L is given by the formula
22.7
where L is the angular momentum, me is the electron’s mass, rn is the radius of the n th orbit, and h is Planck’s constant. Note
. For a small object at a radius r,
, and
, so that
that angular momentum is
Quantization says that the value of mvr can only be equal to h / 2, 2h / 2, 3h / 2, etc. At the time,
Bohr himself did not know why angular momentum should be quantized, but by using that assumption, he was able to calculate
the energies in the hydrogen spectrum, something no one else had done at the time.

Derivation 3 (Finding the Energy of the Orbiting Electron)
To get the electron orbital energies, we start by noting that the electron energy is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy.

Kinetic energy is the familiar

WORKED EXAMPLE
A hydrogen atom is struck by a photon. How much energy must be absorbed from the photon to raise the electron of the
hydrogen atom from its ground state to its second orbital?
Strategy
The hydrogen atom has an atomic number of Z = 1. Raising the electron from the ground state to its second orbital will increase
its orbital level from n = 1 to n = 2. The energy determined will be measured in electron-volts.
Solution
The amount of energy necessary to cause the change in electron state is the difference between the final and initial energies of
the electron. The final energy state of the electron can be found using

Chapter 22 • The Atom

The amount of energy necessary to change the orbital state of the electron can be found by determining the electron’s change in
energy.
22.18
Discussion
The energy required to change the orbital state of the electron is positive. That means that for the electron to move to a state with
greater energy, energy must be added to the atom. Should the electron drop back down to its original energy state, a change of
–10.2 eV would take place, and 10.2 eV of energy would be emitted from the atom. Just as only quantum amounts of energy may
be absorbed by the atom, only quantum amounts of energy can be emitted from the atom. That helps to explain many of the
quantum light effects that you have learned about previously.

WORKED EXAMPLE
Characteristic X-Ray Energy

Calculate the approximate energy of an X-ray emitted for an n = 2 to n = 1 transition in a tungsten anode in an X-ray tube.
Strategy
How do we calculate energies in a multiple-electron atom? In the case of characteristic X-rays, the following approximate
calculation is reasonable. Characteristic X-rays are produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled. Inner-shell electrons are
nearer the nucleus than others in an atom and thus feel little net effect from the others. That is similar to what happens inside a
charged conductor, where its excess charge is distributed over the surface so that it produces no electric field inside. It is
reasonable to assume the inner-shell electrons have hydrogen-like energies, as given by
22.19
For tungsten, Z = 74, so that the effective charge is 73.
Solution
The amount of energy given off as an X-ray is found using
22.20
where
22.21
and
22.22
Thus,
22.23
Discussion
This large photon energy is typical of characteristic X-rays from heavy elements. It is large compared with other atomic
emissions because it is produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled, and inner-shell electrons are tightly bound.
Characteristic X-ray energies become progressively larger for heavier elements because their energy increases approximately as
Z2. Significant accelerating voltage is needed to create such inner-shell vacancies, because other shells are filled and you cannot
simply bump one electron to a higher filled shell. You must remove it from the atom completely. In the case of tungsten, at least
72.5 kV is needed. Tungsten is a common anode material in X-ray tubes; so much of the energy of the impinging electrons is
absorbed, raising its temperature, that a high-melting-point material like tungsten is required.
The wavelength of light emitted by an atom can also be determined through basic derivations. Let us consider the energy of a
photon emitted from a hydrogen atom in a downward transition, given by the equation

22.28

WORKED EXAMPLE
What wavelength of light is emitted by an electron dropping from the third orbital to the ground state of a hydrogen atom?
Strategy
The ground state of a hydrogen atom is considered the first orbital of the atom. As a result, nf = 1 and ni = 3. The Rydberg
constant has already been determined and will be constant regardless of atom chosen.
Solution
22.29
For the equation above, calculate wavelength based on the known energy states.
22.30
Rearranging the equation for wavelength yields
22.31
Discussion
This wavelength corresponds to light in the ultraviolet spectrum. As a result, we would not be able to see the photon of light
emitted when an electron drops from its third to first energy state. However, it is worth noting that by supplying light of
wavelength precisely 102.6 nm, we can cause the electron in hydrogen to move from its first to its third orbital state.

Limits of Bohr’s Theory and the Quantum Model of the Atom
There are limits to Bohr’s theory. It does not account for the interaction of bound electrons, so it cannot be fully applied to
multielectron atoms, even one as simple as the two-electron helium atom. Bohr’s model is what we call semiclassical. The orbits
are quantized (nonclassical) but are assumed to be simple circular paths (classical). As quantum mechanics was developed, it
became clear that there are no well-defined orbits; rather, there are clouds of probability. Additionally, Bohr’s theory did not
explain that some spectral lines are doublets or split into two when examined closely. While we shall examine a few of those
aspects of quantum mechanics in more detail, it should be kept in mind that Bohr did not fail. Rather, he made very important
steps along the path to greater knowledge and laid the foundation for all of atomic physics that has since evolved.

DeBroglie’s Waves
Following Bohr’s initial work on the hydrogen atom, a decade was to pass before Louis de Broglie proposed that matter has wave
properties. The wave-like properties of matter were subsequently confirmed by observations of electron interference when
scattered from crystals. Electrons can exist only in locations where they interfere constructively. How does that affect electrons
in atomic orbits? When an electron is bound to an atom, its wavelength must fit into a small space, something like a standing
wave on a string (see Figure 22.12). Orbits in which an electron can constructively interfere with itself are allowed. All orbits in
which constructive interference cannot occur are not able to exist. Thus, only certain orbits are allowed. The wave nature of an
electron, according to de Broglie, is why the orbits are quantized!

Figure 22.12 (a) Standing waves on a string have a wavelength related to the length of the string, allowing them to interfere constructively.
(b) If we imagine the string formed into a closed circle, we get a rough idea of how electrons in circular orbits can interfere constructively.
(c) If the wavelength does not fit into the circumference, the electron interferes destructively; it cannot exist in such an orbit.

For a circular orbit, constructive interference occurs when the electron’s wavelength fits neatly into the circumference, so that
wave crests always align with crests and wave troughs align with troughs, as shown in Figure 22.12(b). More precisely, when an
integral multiple of the electron’s wavelength equals the circumference of the orbit, constructive interference is obtained. In
equation form, the condition for constructive interference and an allowed electron orbit is

Heisenberg Uncertainty
How does determining the location of an electron change its trajectory? The answer is fundamentally important—measurement
affects the system being observed. It is impossible to measure a physical quantity exactly, and greater precision in measuring
one quantity produces less precision in measuring a related quantity. It was Werner Heisenberg who first stated that limit to
knowledge in 1929 as a result of his work on quantum mechanics and the wave characteristics of all particles (see Figure 22.14).

Figure 22.14 Werner Heisenberg was the physicist who developed the first version of true quantum mechanics. Not only did his work give a
description of nature on the very small scale, it also changed our view of the availability of knowledge. Although he is universally recognized
for the importance of his work by receiving the Nobel Prize in 1932, for example, Heisenberg remained in Germany during World War II and
headed the German effort to build a nuclear bomb, permanently alienating himself from most of the scientific community. (credit: Unknown

For example, you can measure the position of a moving electron by scattering light or other electrons from it. However, by doing
so, you are giving the electron energy, and therefore imparting momentum to it. As a result, the momentum of the electron is
affected and cannot be determined precisely. This change in momentum could be anywhere from close to zero up to the relative
momentum of the electron (
). Note that, in this case, the particle is an electron, but the principle applies to any
particle.
Viewing the electron through the model of wave-particle duality, Heisenberg recognized that, because a wave is not located at
one fixed point in space, there is an uncertainty associated with any electron’s position. That uncertainty in position,
, is
. There is an interesting trade-off between position and
approximately equal to the wavelength of the particle. That is,
momentum. The uncertainty in an electron’s position can be reduced by using a shorter-wavelength electron, since
.
But shortening the wavelength increases the uncertainty in momentum, since
. Conversely, the uncertainty in
momentum can be reduced by using a longer-wavelength electron, but that increases the uncertainty in position.
Mathematically, you can express the trade-off by multiplying the uncertainties. The wavelength cancels, leaving

Therefore, if one uncertainty is reduced, the other must increase so that their product is
. With the use of advanced
mathematics, Heisenberg showed that the best that can be done in a simultaneous measurement of position and momentum is
22.33
That relationship is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

The Quantum Model of the Atom
Because of the wave characteristic of matter, the idea of well-defined orbits gives way to a model in which there is a cloud of
probability, consistent with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Figure 22.15 shows how the principle applies to the ground state
of hydrogen. If you try to follow the electron in some well-defined orbit using a probe that has a wavelength small enough to

733

734

Chapter 22 • The Atom

measure position accurately, you will instead knock the electron out of its orbit. Each measurement of the electron’s position
will find it to be in a definite location somewhere near the nucleus. Repeated measurements reveal a cloud of probability like
that in the figure, with each speck the location determined by a single measurement. There is not a well-defined, circular-orbit
type of distribution. Nature again proves to be different on a small scale than on a macroscopic scale.

Figure 22.15 The ground state of a hydrogen atom has a probability cloud describing the position of its electron. The probability of finding
the electron is proportional to the darkness of the cloud. The electron can be closer or farther than the Bohr radius, but it is very unlikely to
be a great distance from the nucleus.

There is an ongoing quest to find the substructures of matter. At one time, it was thought that atoms would be the ultimate
substructure. However, just when the first direct evidence of atoms was obtained, it became clear that they have a substructure
and a tiny nucleus. The nucleus itself has spectacular characteristics. For example, certain nuclei are unstable, and their decay
emits radiations with energies millions of times greater than atomic energies. Some of the mysteries of nature, such as why the
core of Earth remains molten and how the Sun produces its energy, are explained by nuclear phenomena. The exploration of
radioactivity and the nucleus has revealed new fundamental particles, forces, and conservation laws. That exploration has
evolved into a search for further underlying structures, such as quarks. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of the
nucleus and nuclear radioactivity.

The Structure of the Nucleus
At this point, you are likely familiar with the neutron and proton, the two fundamental particles that make up the nucleus of an
atom. Those two particles, collectively called nucleons, make up the small interior portion of the atom. Both particles have
nearly the same mass, although the neutron is about two parts in 1,000 more massive. The mass of a proton is equivalent to 1,836
electrons, while the mass of a neutron is equivalent to that of 1,839 electrons. That said, each of the particles is significantly more
massive than the electron.
When describing the mass of objects on the scale of nucleons and atoms, it is most reasonable to measure their mass in terms of
atoms. The atomic mass unit (u) was originally defined so that a neutral carbon atom would have a mass of exactly 12 u. Given
that protons and neutrons are approximately the same mass, that there are six protons and six neutrons in a carbon atom, and
that the mass of an electron is minuscule in comparison, measuring this way allows for both protons and neutrons to have
masses close to 1 u. Table 22.1 shows the mass of protons, neutrons, and electrons on the new scale.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
For most conceptual situations, the difference in mass between the proton and neutron is insubstantial. In fact, for
calculations that require fewer than four significant digits, both the proton and neutron masses may be considered
equivalent to one atomic mass unit. However, when determining the amount of energy released in a nuclear reaction, as in
Equation 22.40, the difference in mass cannot be ignored.
. While rarely used in most contexts, it is convenient when

Table 22.1 Atomic Masses for Multiple Units
To more completely characterize nuclei, let us also consider two other important quantities: the atomic number and the mass
number. The atomic number, Z, represents the number of protons within a nucleus. That value determines the elemental
quality of each atom. Every carbon atom, for instance, has a Z value of 6, whereas every oxygen atom has a Z value of 8. For
clarification, only oxygen atoms may have a Z value of 8. If the Z value is not 8, the atom cannot be oxygen.
The mass number, A, represents the total number of protons and neutrons, or nucleons, within an atom. For an ordinary carbon
atom the mass number would be 12, as there are typically six neutrons accompanying the six protons within the atom. In the
case of carbon, the mass would be exactly 12 u. For oxygen, with a mass number of 16, the atomic mass is 15.994915 u. Of course,
the difference is minor and can be ignored for most scenarios. Again, because the mass of an electron is so small compared to
the nucleons, the mass number and the atomic mass can be essentially equivalent. Figure 22.16 shows an example of Lithium-7,
which has an atomic number of 3 and a mass number of 7.
How does the mass number help to differentiate one atom from another? If each atom of carbon has an atomic number of 6,

735

736

Chapter 22 • The Atom

then what is the value of including the mass number at all? The intent of the mass number is to differentiate between various
isotopes of an atom. The term isotope refers to the variation of atoms based upon the number of neutrons within their nucleus.
While it is most common for there to be six neutrons accompanying the six protons within a carbon atom, it is possible to find
carbon atoms with seven neutrons or eight neutrons. Those carbon atoms are respectively referred to as carbon-13 and carbon-14
atoms, with their mass numbers being their primary distinction. The isotope distinction is an important one to make, as the
number of neutrons within an atom can affect a number of its properties, not the least of which is nuclear stability.

Figure 22.16 Lithium-7 has three protons and four neutrons within its nucleus. As a result, its mass number is 7, while its atomic number is
3. The actual mass of the atom is 7.016 u. Lithium 7 is an isotope of lithium.

To more easily identify various atoms, their atomic number and mass number are typically written in a form of representation
called the nuclide. The nuclide form appears as follows:
, where X is the atomic symbol and N represents the number of
neutrons.
Let us look at a few examples of nuclides expressed in the

notation. The nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen, is a single

(the zero for no neutrons is often omitted). To check the symbol, refer to the periodic table—you see that the
proton, or
atomic number Z of hydrogen is 1. Since you are given that there are no neutrons, the mass number A is also 1. There is a scarce
form of hydrogen found in nature called deuterium; its nucleus has one proton and one neutron and, hence, twice the mass of
common hydrogen. The symbol for deuterium is, thus,
. An even rarer—and radioactive—form of hydrogen is called
tritium, since it has a single proton and two neutrons, and it is written
. The three varieties of hydrogen have nearly
identical chemistries, but the nuclei differ greatly in mass, stability, and other characteristics. Again, the different nuclei are
referred to as isotopes of the same element.
There is some redundancy in the symbols A, X, Z, and N. If the element X is known, then Z can be found in a periodic table. If
both A and X are known, then N can also be determined by first finding Z; then, N = A – Z. Thus the simpler notation for
nuclides is
22.34
which is sufficient and is most commonly used. For example, in this simpler notation, the three isotopes of hydrogen are
,
, and
. For
, should we need to know, we can determine that Z = 92 for uranium from the periodic table, and thus, N
= 238 − 92 = 146.

Radioactivity and Nuclear Forces
In 1896, the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) noticed something strange. When a uranium-rich mineral
called pitchblende was placed on a completely opaque envelope containing a photographic plate, it darkened spots on the
photographic plate.. Becquerel reasoned that the pitchblende must emit invisible rays capable of penetrating the opaque
material. Stranger still was that no light was shining on the pitchblende, which means that the pitchblende was emitting the
invisible rays continuously without having any energy input! There is an apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy,
It was soon evident that Becquerel’s rays
one that scientists can now explain using Einstein’s famous equation
originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics.
To this point, most reactions you have studied have been chemical reactions, which are reactions involving the electrons

22.2 • Nuclear Forces and Radioactivity

surrounding the atoms. However, two types of experimental evidence implied that Becquerel’s rays did not originate with
electrons, but instead within the nucleus of an atom.
First, the radiation is found to be only associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Whether uranium was in the form of
an element or compound was irrelevant to its radiation. In addition, the presence of radiation does not vary with temperature,
pressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of those factors affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot
come from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do.
The huge energy emitted during each event is the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be atomic. Nuclear
radiation has energies on the order of 106 eV per event, which is much greater than typical atomic energies that are a few eV,
such as those observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most energetic X-rays.
But why would reactions within the nucleus take place? And what would cause an apparently stable structure to begin emitting
energy? Was there something special about Becquerel’s uranium-rich pitchblende? To answer those questions, it is necessary to
look into the structure of the nucleus. Though it is perhaps surprising, you will find that many of the same principles that we
observe on a macroscopic level still apply to the nucleus.

Nuclear Stability
A variety of experiments indicate that a nucleus behaves something like a tightly packed ball of nucleons, as illustrated in Figure
22.17. Those nucleons have large kinetic energies and, thus, move rapidly in very close contact. Nucleons can be separated by a
large force, such as in a collision with another nucleus, but strongly resist being pushed closer together. The most compelling
evidence that nucleons are closely packed in a nucleus is that the radius of a nucleus, r, is found to be approximately
22.35
where
Note that

1.2 femtometer (fm) and A is the mass number of the nucleus.
. Since many nuclei are spherical, and the volume of a sphere is

, we see that

—that is,

the volume of a nucleus is proportional to the number of nucleons in it. That is what you expect if you pack nucleons so close
that there is no empty space between them.

Figure 22.17 Nucleons are held together by nuclear forces and resist both being pulled apart and pushed inside one another. The volume of
the nucleus is the sum of the volumes of the nucleons in it, here shown in different colors to represent protons and neutrons.

So what forces hold a nucleus together? After all, the nucleus is very small and its protons, being positive, should exert
tremendous repulsive forces on one another. Considering that, it seems that the nucleus would be forced apart, not together!
The answer is that a previously unknown force holds the nucleus together and makes it into a tightly packed ball of nucleons.
This force is known as the strong nuclear force. The strong force has such a short range that it quickly fall to zero over a distance
of only 10–15 meters. However, like glue, it is very strong when the nucleons get close to one another.
The balancing of the electromagnetic force with the nuclear forces is what allows the nucleus to maintain its spherical shape. If,
for any reason, the electromagnetic force should overcome the nuclear force, components of the nucleus would be projected
outward, creating the very radiation that Becquerel discovered!
Understanding why the nucleus would break apart can be partially explained using Table 22.2. The balance between the strong
nuclear force and the electromagnetic force is a tenuous one. Recall that the attractive strong nuclear force exists between any
two nucleons and acts over a very short range while the weaker repulsive electromagnetic force only acts between protons,
although over a larger range. Considering the interactions, an imperfect balance between neutrons and protons can result in a
nuclear reaction, with the result of regaining equilibrium.

Table 22.2 Comparing the Electromagnetic and Strong Forces
The radiation discovered by Becquerel was due to the large number of protons present in his uranium-rich pitchblende. In short,
the large number of protons caused the electromagnetic force to be greater than the strong nuclear force. To regain stability, the
nucleus needed to undergo a nuclear reaction called alpha (α) decay.

The Three Types of Radiation
Radioactivity refers to the act of emitting particles or energy from the nucleus. When the uranium nucleus emits energetic
nucleons in Becquerel’s experiment, the radioactive process causes the nucleus to alter in structure. The alteration is called
radioactive decay. Any substance that undergoes radioactive decay is said to be radioactive. That those terms share a root with
the term radiation should not be too surprising, as they all relate to the transmission of energy.

Alpha Decay
Alpha decay refers to the type of decay that takes place when too many protons exist in the nucleus. It is the most common type
of decay and causes the nucleus to regain equilibrium between its two competing internal forces. During alpha decay, the
nucleus ejects two protons and two neutrons, allowing the strong nuclear force to regain balance with the repulsive
electromagnetic force. The nuclear equation for an alpha decay process can be shown as follows.
22.36

Figure 22.18 A nucleus undergoes alpha decay. The alpha particle can be seen as made up of two neutrons and two protons, which
constitute a helium-4 atom.

Three things to note as a result of the above equation:
1. By ejecting an alpha particle, the original nuclide decreases in atomic number. That means that Becquerel’s uranium
nucleus, upon decaying, is actually transformed into thorium, two atomic numbers lower on the periodic table! The process
of changing elemental composition is called transmutation.
2. Note that the two protons and two neutrons ejected from the nucleus combine to form a helium nucleus. Shortly after
decay, the ejected helium ion typically acquires two electrons to become a stable helium atom.
3. Finally, it is important to see that, despite the elemental change, physical conservation still takes place. The mass number of
the new element and the alpha particle together equal the mass number of the original element. Also, the net charge of all
particles involved remains the same before and after the transmutation.

Beta Decay
Like alpha decay, beta ( ) decay also takes place when there is an imbalance between neutrons and protons within the nucleus.
For beta decay, however, a neutron is transformed into a proton and electron or vice versa. The transformation allows for the
total mass number of the atom to remain the same, although the atomic number will increase by one (or decrease by one). Once
again, the transformation of the neutron allows for a rebalancing of the strong nuclear and electromagnetic forces. The nuclear

equation for a beta decay process is shown below.

The symbol in the equation above stands for a high-energy particle called the neutrino. A nucleus may also emit a positron,
and in that case Z decreases and N increases. It is beyond the scope of this section and will be discussed in further detail in the
chapter on particles. It is worth noting, however, that the mass number and charge in all beta-decay reactions are conserved.

Figure 22.19 A nucleus undergoes beta decay. The neutron splits into a proton, electron, and neutrino. This particular decay is called
decay.

Gamma Decay
Gamma decay is a unique form of radiation that does not involve balancing forces within the nucleus. Gamma decay occurs
when a nucleus drops from an excited state to the ground state. Recall that such a change in energy state will release energy
from the nucleus in the form of a photon. The energy associated with the photon emitted is so great that its wavelength is
shorter than that of an X-ray. Its nuclear equation is as follows.

Strategy
Beta decay results in an increase in atomic number. As a result, the original (or parent) nucleus, must have an atomic number of
one fewer proton.
Solution
The equation for beta decay is as follows
22.38

an atomic number of 55. That corresponds to cesium, or Cs.
22.39

739

Chapter 22 • The Atom

The number of neutrons in the parent cesium and daughter barium can be determined by subtracting the atomic number from
the mass number (137 – 55 for cesium, 137 – 56 for barium). Substitute those values for the N and N – 1 subscripts in the above
equation.
22.40
Discussion
The terms parent and daughter nucleus refer to the reactants and products of a nuclear reaction. The terminology is not just
used in this example, but in all nuclear reaction examples. The cesium-137 nuclear reaction poses a significant health risk, as its
chemistry is similar to that of potassium and sodium, and so it can easily be concentrated in your cells if ingested.

The energy released in this decay is in the MeV range, about 106 times as great as typical chemical reaction energies, consistent
with previous discussions. Most of the energy becomes kinetic energy of the particle (or 4He nucleus), which moves away at
high speed.
The energy carried away by the recoil of the 235U nucleus is much smaller, in order to conserve momentum. The 235U nucleus can
be left in an excited state to later emit photons ( rays). The decay is spontaneous and releases energy, because the products have
less mass than the parent nucleus.

Properties of Radiation
The charges of the three radiated particles differ. Alpha particles, with two protons, carry a net charge of +2. Beta particles, with
one electron, carry a net charge of –1. Meanwhile, gamma rays are solely photons, or light, and carry no charge. The difference

22.2 • Nuclear Forces and Radioactivity

in charge plays an important role in how the three radiations affect surrounding substances.
Alpha particles, being highly charged, will quickly interact with ions in the air and electrons within metals. As a result, they have
a short range and short penetrating distance in most materials. Beta particles, being slightly less charged, have a larger range
and larger penetrating distance. Gamma rays, on the other hand, have little electric interaction with particles and travel much
farther. Two diagrams below show the importance of difference in penetration. Table 22.3 shows the distance of radiation
penetration, and Figure 22.21 shows the influence various factors have on radiation penetration distance.

LINKS TO PHYSICS
Radiation Detectors

The first direct detection of radiation was Becquerel’s darkened photographic plate. Photographic film is still the most common
detector of ionizing radiation, being used routinely in medical and dental X-rays. Nuclear radiation can also be captured on
film, as seen in Figure 22.22. The mechanism for film exposure by radiation is similar to that by photons. A quantum of energy
from a radioactive particle interacts with the emulsion and alters it chemically, thus exposing the film. Provided the radiation
has more than the few eV of energy needed to induce the chemical change, the chemical alteration will occur. The amount of film
darkening is related to the type of radiation and amount of exposure. The process is not 100 percent efficient, since not all
incident radiation interacts and not all interactions produce the chemical change.

Another very common radiation detector is the Geiger tube. The clicking and buzzing sound we hear in dramatizations and
documentaries, as well as in our own physics labs, is usually an audio output of events detected by a Geiger counter. These
relatively inexpensive radiation detectors are based on the simple and sturdy Geiger tube, shown schematically in Figure 22.23.
A conducting cylinder with a wire along its axis is filled with an insulating gas so that a voltage applied between the cylinder and
wire produces almost no current. Ionizing radiation passing through the tube produces free ion pairs that are attracted to the
wire and cylinder, forming a current that is detected as a count. Not every particle is detected, since some radiation can pass
through without producing enough ionization. However, Geiger counters are very useful in producing a prompt output that
reveals the existence and relative intensity of ionizing radiation.

Figure 22.23 (a) Geiger counters such as this one are used for prompt monitoring of radiation levels, generally giving only relative intensity
and not identifying the type or energy of the radiation. (credit: Tim Vickers, Wikimedia Commons) (b) Voltage applied between the cylinder
and wire in a Geiger tube affects ions and electrons produced by radiation passing through the gas-filled cylinder. Ions move toward the
cylinder and electrons toward the wire. The resulting current is detected and registered as a count.

Another radiation detection method records light produced when radiation interacts with materials. The energy of the radiation
is sufficient to excite atoms in a material that may fluoresce, such as the phosphor used by Rutherford’s group. Materials called
scintillators use a more complex process to convert radiation energy into light. Scintillators may be liquid or solid, and they can

be very efficient. Their light output can provide information about the energy, charge, and type of radiation. Scintillator light
flashes are very brief in duration, allowing the detection of a huge number of particles in short periods of time. Scintillation
detectors are used in a variety of research and diagnostic applications. Among those are the detection of the radiation from
distant galaxies using satellite-mounted equipment and the detection of exotic particles in accelerator laboratories.

Half-Life and the Rate of Radioactive Decay
Unstable nuclei decay. However, some nuclides decay faster than others. For example, radium and polonium, discovered by
Marie and Pierre Curie, decay faster than uranium. That means they have shorter lifetimes, producing a greater rate of decay.
Here we will explore half-life and activity, the quantitative terms for lifetime and rate of decay.
Why do we use the term like half-life rather than lifetime? The answer can be found by examining Figure 22.24, which shows
how the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decreases with time. The time in which half of the original number of nuclei
decay is defined as the half-life,
. After one half-life passes, half of the remaining nuclei will decay in the next half-life. Then,
half of that amount in turn decays in the following half-life. Therefore, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases from N to N /
2 in one half-life, to N / 4 in the next, to N / 8 in the next, and so on. Nuclear decay is an example of a purely statistical process.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
A more precise definition of half-life is that each nucleus has a 50 percent chance of surviving for a time equal to one halflife. If an individual nucleus survives through that time, it still has a 50 percent chance of surviving through another half-life.
Even if it happens to survive hundreds of half-lives, it still has a 50 percent chance of surviving through one more. Therefore,
the decay of a nucleus is like random coin flipping. The chance of heads is 50 percent, no matter what has happened before.
The probability concept aligns with the traditional definition of half-life. Provided the number of nuclei is reasonably large,
half of the original nuclei should decay during one half-life period.

Activity, the Rate of Decay
What do we mean when we say a source is highly radioactive? Generally, it means the number of decays per unit time is very
high. We define activity R to be the rate of decay expressed in decays per unit time. In equation form, this is

Activity can also be determined through the equation
22.48
which shows that as the amount of radiative material (N) decreases, the rate of decay decreases as well.
The SI unit for activity is one decay per second and it is given the name becquerel (Bq) in honor of the discoverer of radioactivity.
That is,

Activity R is often expressed in other units, such as decays per minute or decays per year. One of the most common units for

Radiometric Dating
Radioactive dating or radiometric dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity. Its most familiar application is
particles within the
carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 is an isotope of carbon that is produced when solar neutrinos strike
atmosphere. Radioactive carbon has the same chemistry as stable carbon, and so it mixes into the biosphere, where it is
consumed and becomes part of every living organism. Carbon-14 has an abundance of 1.3 parts per trillion of normal carbon, so
if you know the number of carbon nuclei in an object (perhaps determined by mass and Avogadro’s number), you can multiply
that number by
to find the number of
nuclei within the object. Over time, carbon-14 will naturally decay
with a half-life of 5,730 years (note that this is an example of beta decay). When an organism dies, carbon exchange

in an artifact, such as mummy
with the environment ceases, and
wrappings, with the normal abundance in living tissue, it is possible to determine the artifact’s age (or time since death).
Carbon-14 dating can be used for biological tissues as old as 50 or 60 thousand years, but is most accurate for younger samples,

One of the most famous cases of carbon-14 dating involves the Shroud of Turin, a long piece of fabric purported to be the burial
shroud of Jesus (see Figure 22.25). This relic was first displayed in Turin in 1354 and was denounced as a fraud at that time by a
French bishop. Its remarkable negative imprint of an apparently crucified body resembles the then-accepted image of Jesus. As a
result, the relic has been remained controversial throughout the centuries. Carbon-14 dating was not performed on the shroud
until 1988, when the process had been refined to the point where only a small amount of material needed to be destroyed.
Samples were tested at three independent laboratories, each being given four pieces of cloth, with only one unidentified piece
found in
from the shroud, to avoid prejudice. All three laboratories found samples of the shroud contain 92 percent of the
living tissues, allowing the shroud to be dated (see Equation 22.57).

(a) The decay constant shows that 0.0568 percent of the nuclei in a carbon-11 sample will decay each second. Another way of
considering the decay constant is that a given carbon-11 nuclei has a 0.0568 percent probability of decaying each second. The

challenges for its administration.
(b) One hour is nearly three full half-lives of the carbon-11 nucleus. As a result, one would expect the amount of sample

This dates the material in the shroud to 1988–690 = 1300. Our calculation is only accurate to two digits, so that the year is
rounded to 1300. The values obtained at the three independent laboratories gave a weighted average date of 1320 ± 60. That
uncertainty is typical of carbon-14 dating and is due to the small amount of 14 C in living tissues, the amount of material
available, and experimental uncertainties (reduced by having three independent measurements). That said, is it notable that the

The previous section dealt with naturally occurring nuclear decay. Without human intervention, some nuclei will change
composition in order to achieve a stable equilibrium. This section delves into a less-natural process. Knowing that energy can be
emitted in various forms of nuclear change, is it possible to create a nuclear reaction through our own intervention? The answer
to this question is yes. Through two distinct methods, humankind has discovered multiple ways of manipulating the atom to
release its internal energy.

Nuclear Fission
In simplest terms, nuclear fission is the splitting of an atomic bond. Given that it requires great energy separate two nucleons,
it may come as a surprise to learn that splitting a nucleus can release vast potential energy. And although it is true that huge
amounts of energy can be released, considerable effort is needed to do so in practice.
An unstable atom will naturally decay, but it may take millions of years to do so. As a result, a physical catalyst is necessary to
produce useful energy through nuclear fission. The catalyst typically occurs in the form of a free neutron, projected directly at
the nucleus of a high-mass atom.
As shown in Figure 22.26, a neutron strike can cause the nucleus to elongate, much like a drop of liquid water. This is why the
model is known as the liquid drop model. As the nucleus elongates, nucleons are no longer so tightly packed, and the repulsive
electromagnetic force can overcome the short-range strong nuclear force. The imbalance of forces can result in the two ends of
the drop flying apart, with some of the nuclear binding energy released to the surroundings.

Figure 22.26 Neutron-induced fission is shown. First, energy is put into a large nucleus when it absorbs a neutron. Acting like a struck liquid
drop, the nucleus deforms and begins to narrow in the middle. Since fewer nucleons are in contact, the repulsive Coulomb force is able to
break the nucleus into two parts with some neutrons also flying away.

As you can imagine, the consequences of the nuclei splitting are substantial. When a nucleus is split, it is not only energy that is
released, but a small number of neutrons as well. Those neutrons have the potential to cause further fission in other nuclei,
especially if they are directed back toward the other nuclei by a dense shield or neutron reflector (see part (d) of Figure 22.26).

22.4 • Nuclear Fission and Fusion

However, not every neutron produced by fission induces further fission. Some neutrons escape the fissionable material, while
others interact with a nucleus without making it split. We can enhance the number of fissions produced by neutrons by having a
large amount of fissionable material as well as a neutron reflector. The minimum amount necessary for self-sustained fission of
a given nuclide is called its critical mass. Some nuclides, such as 239Pu, produce more neutrons per fission than others, such as
235U. Additionally, some nuclides are easier to make fission than others. In particular, 235U and 239Pu are easier to fission than
the much more abundant 238U. Both factors affect critical mass, which is smallest for 239Pu. The self-sustained fission of nuclei is
commonly referred to as a chain reaction, as shown in Figure 22.27.

Figure 22.27 A chain reaction can produce self-sustained fission if each fission produces enough neutrons to induce at least one more
fission. This depends on several factors, including how many neutrons are produced in an average fission and how easy it is to make a
particular type of nuclide fission.

A chain reaction can have runaway results. If each atomic split results in two nuclei producing a new fission, the number of
nuclear reactions will increase exponentially. One fission will produce two atoms, the next round of fission will create four
atoms, the third round eight atoms, and so on. Of course, each time fission occurs, more energy will be emitted, further
increasing the power of the atomic reaction. And that is just if two neutrons create fission reactions each round. Perhaps you
can now see why so many people consider atomic energy to be an exciting energy source!
To make a self-sustained nuclear fission reactor with 235U, it is necessary to slow down the neutrons. Water is very effective at
this, since neutrons collide with protons in water molecules and lose energy. Figure 22.28 shows a schematic of a reactor design
called the pressurized water reactor.

749

750

Chapter 22 • The Atom

Figure 22.28 A pressurized water reactor is cleverly designed to control the fission of large amounts of 235U, while using the heat produced
in the fission reaction to create steam for generating electrical energy. Control rods adjust neutron flux so that it is self-sustaining. In case
the reactor overheats and boils the water away, the chain reaction terminates, because water is needed to slow down the neutrons. This
inherent safety feature can be overwhelmed in extreme circumstances.

Control rods containing nuclides that very strongly absorb neutrons are used to adjust neutron flux. To produce large amounts
of power, reactors contain hundreds to thousands of critical masses, and the chain reaction easily becomes self-sustaining.
Neutron flux must be carefully regulated to avoid an out-of-control exponential increase in the rate of fission.
Control rods help prevent overheating, perhaps even a meltdown or explosive disassembly. The water that is used to slow down
neutrons, necessary to get them to induce fission in 235U, and achieve criticality, provides a negative feedback for temperature
increase. In case the reactor overheats and boils the water to steam or is breached, the absence of water kills the chain reaction.
Considerable heat, however, can still be generated by the reactor’s radioactive fission products. Other safety features, thus, need
to be incorporated in the event of a loss of coolant accident, including auxiliary cooling water and pumps.

Energies in Nuclear Fission
The following are two interesting facts to consider:
• The average fission reaction produces 200 MeV of energy.
• If you were to measure the mass of the products of a nuclear reaction, you would find that their mass was slightly less than
the mass of the original nucleus.
How are those things possible? Doesn’t the fission reaction’s production of energy violate the conservation of energy?
Furthermore, doesn’t the loss in mass in the reaction violate the conservation of mass? Those are important questions, and they
can both be answered with one of the most famous equations in scientific history.
22.65
Recall that, according to Einstein’s theory, energy and mass are essentially the same thing. In the case of fission, the mass of the
products is less than that of the reactants because the missing mass appears in the form of the energy released in the reaction,
with a constant value of c2 Joules of energy converted for each kilogram of material. The value of c2 is substantial—from
Einstein’s equation, the amount of energy in just 1 gram of mass would be enough to support the average U.S. citizen for more
than 270 years! The example below will show you how a mass-energy transformation of this type takes place.

The result is another impressively large amount of energy, equivalent to about 14,000 barrels of crude oil or 600,000 gallons of
gasoline. But, it is only one fourth the energy produced by the fusion of a kilogram of a mixture of deuterium and tritium. Even
though each fission reaction yields about ten times the energy of a fusion reaction, the energy per kilogram of fission fuel is less,
because there are far fewer moles per kilogram of the heavy nuclides. Fission fuel is also much scarcer than fusion fuel, and less
than 1 percent of uranium (the 235 U) is readily usable.

Nuclear Fusion
Nuclear fusion is defined as the combining, or fusing, of two nuclei and, the combining of nuclei also results in an emission of
energy. For many, the concept is counterintuitive. After all, if energy is released when a nucleus is split, how can it also be
released when nucleons are combined together? The difference between fission and fusion, which results from the size of the
nuclei involved, will be addressed next.
Remember that the structure of a nucleus is based on the interplay of the compressive nuclear strong force and the repulsive
electromagnetic force. For nuclei that are less massive than iron, the nuclear force is actually stronger than that of the Coulomb
force. As a result, when a low-mass nucleus absorbs nucleons, the added neutrons and protons bind the nucleus more tightly.
The increased nuclear strong force does work on the nucleus, and energy is released.
Once the size of the created nucleus exceeds that of iron, the short-ranging nuclear force does not have the ability to bind a
nucleus more tightly, and the emission of energy ceases. In fact, for fusion to occur for elements of greater mass than iron,
energy must be added to the system! Figure 22.29 shows an energy-mass curve commonly used to describe nuclear reactions.
Notice the location of iron (Fe) on the graph. All low-mass nuclei to the left of iron release energy through fusion, while all highmass particles to the right of iron produce energy through fission.

greater for the product nuclei. The larger

) is

is, the less mass per nucleon, and so mass is converted to energy and released in such

fusion reactions.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Just as it is not possible for the elements to the left of iron in the figure to naturally fission, it is not possible for elements to
the right of iron to naturally undergo fusion, as that process would require the addition of energy to occur. Furthermore,
notice that elements commonly discussed in fission and fusion are elements that can provide the greatest change in binding
energy, such as uranium and hydrogen.
Iron’s location on the energy-mass curve is important, and explains a number of its characteristics, including its role as an
elemental endpoint in fusion reactions in stars.
The major obstruction to fusion is the Coulomb repulsion force between nuclei. Since the attractive nuclear force that can fuse
nuclei together is short ranged, the repulsion of like positive charges must be overcome in order to get nuclei close enough to
induce fusion. Figure 22.30 shows an approximate graph of the potential energy between two nuclei as a function of the
distance between their centers. The graph resembles a hill with a well in its center. A ball rolled to the left must have enough
kinetic energy to get over the hump before it falls into the deeper well with a net gain in energy. So it is with fusion. If the nuclei
are given enough kinetic energy to overcome the electric potential energy due to repulsion, then they can combine, release
energy, and fall into a deep well. One way to accomplish that end is to heat fusion fuel to high temperatures so that the kinetic
energy of thermal motion is sufficient to get the nuclei together.

Figure 22.30 Potential energy between two light nuclei graphed as a function of distance between them. If the nuclei have enough kinetic
energy to get over the Coulomb repulsion hump, they combine, release energy, and drop into a deep attractive well.

You might think that, in our Sun, nuclei are constantly coming into contact and fusing. However, this is only partially true. Only
at the Sun’s core are the particles close enough and the temperature high enough for fusion to occur!

where the 26.7 MeV includes the annihilation energy of the positrons and electrons and is distributed among all the reaction
products. The solar interior is dense, and the reactions occur deep in the Sun where temperatures are highest. It takes about
32,000 years for the energy to diffuse to the surface and radiate away. However, the neutrinos can carry their energy out of the
Sun in less than two seconds, because they interact so weakly with other matter. Negative feedback in the Sun acts as a
thermostat to regulate the overall energy output. For instance, if the interior of the Sun becomes hotter than normal, the
reaction rate increases, producing energy that expands the interior. The expansion cools it and lowers the reaction rate.
Conversely, if the interior becomes too cool, it contracts, increasing the temperature and therefore the reaction rate (see Figure
22.31). Stars like the Sun are stable for billions of years, until a significant fraction of their hydrogen has been depleted.

Figure 22.31 Nuclear fusion in the Sun converts hydrogen nuclei into helium; fusion occurs primarily at the boundary of the helium core,
where the temperature is highest and sufficient hydrogen remains. Energy released diffuses slowly to the surface, with the exception of
neutrinos, which escape immediately. Energy production remains stable because of negative-feedback effects.

Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear Power
The world was in political turmoil when fission was discovered in 1938. Compounding the troubles, the possibility of a selfsustained chain reaction was immediately recognized by leading scientists the world over. The enormous energy known to be in
nuclei, but considered inaccessible, now seemed to be available on a large scale.
Within months after the announcement of the discovery of fission, Adolf Hitler banned the export of uranium from newly
occupied Czechoslovakia. It seemed that the possible military value of uranium had been recognized in Nazi Germany, and that
a serious effort to build a nuclear bomb had begun.
Alarmed scientists, many of whom fled Nazi Germany, decided to take action. None was more famous or revered than Einstein.
It was felt that his help was needed to get the American government to make a serious effort at constructing nuclear weapons as
a matter of survival. Leo Szilard, a Hungarian physicist who had emigrated to America, took a draft of a letter to Einstein, who,
although a pacifist, signed the final version. The letter was for President Franklin Roosevelt, warning of the German potential to
build extremely powerful bombs of a new type. It was sent in August of 1939, just before the German invasion of Poland that
marked the start of World War II.
It was not until December 6, 1941, the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, that the United States made a massive
commitment to building a nuclear bomb. The top secret Manhattan Project was a crash program aimed at beating the Germans.

753

754

Chapter 22 • The Atom

It was carried out in remote locations, such as Los Alamos, New Mexico, whenever possible, and eventually came to cost billions
of dollars and employ the efforts of more than 100,000 people. J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967), a talented physicist, was
chosen to head the project. The first major step was made by Enrico Fermi and his group in December 1942, when they
completed the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor. This first atomic pile, built in a squash court at the University of Chicago,
proved that a fission chain reaction was possible.
Plutonium was recognized as easier to fission with neutrons and, hence, a superior fission material very early in the Manhattan
Project. Plutonium availability was uncertain, and so a uranium bomb was developed simultaneously. Figure 22.32 shows a guntype bomb, which takes two subcritical uranium masses and shoots them together. To get an appreciable yield, the critical mass
must be held together by the explosive charges inside the cannon barrel for a few microseconds. Since the buildup of the
uranium chain reaction is relatively slow, the device to bring the critical mass together can be relatively simple. Owing to the fact
that the rate of spontaneous fission is low, a neutron source is at the center the assembled critical mass.

Figure 22.32 A gun-type fission bomb for

utilizes two subcritical masses forced together by explosive charges inside a cannon barrel.

The energy yield depends on the amount of uranium and the time it can be held together before it disassembles itself.

Plutonium’s special properties necessitated a more sophisticated critical mass assembly, shown schematically in Figure 22.33. A
spherical mass of plutonium is surrounded by shaped charges (high explosives that focus their blast) that implode the
plutonium, crushing it into a smaller volume to form a critical mass. The implosion technique is faster and more effective,
because it compresses three-dimensionally rather than one-dimensionally as in the gun-type bomb. Again, a neutron source is
included to initiate the chain reaction.

plutonium has made it the preferred bomb material.

Owing to its complexity, the plutonium bomb needed to be tested before there could be any attempt to use it. On July 16, 1945,
the test named Trinity was conducted in the isolated Alamogordo Desert in New Mexico, about 200 miles south of Los Alamos
(see Figure 22.34). A new age had begun. The yield of the Trinity device was about 10 kilotons (kT), the equivalent of 5,000 of the
largest conventional bombs.

Figure 22.34 Trinity test (1945), the first nuclear bomb (credit: U.S. Department of Energy)

Although Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945, Japan had been steadfastly refusing to surrender for many months, resulting
large numbers of civilian and military casualties. Invasion plans by the Allies estimated a million casualties of their own and
untold losses of Japanese lives. The bomb was viewed as a way to end the war. The first bomb used was a gun-type uranium bomb
dropped on Hiroshima on August 6 by the United States. Its yield of about 15 kT destroyed the city and killed an estimated
80,000 people, with 100,000 more being seriously injured. The second bomb was an implosion-type plutonium bomb dropped
on Nagasaki only three days later. Its 20-kT yield killed at least 50,000 people, something less than Hiroshima because of the
hilly terrain and the fact that it was a few kilometers off target. The Japanese were told that one bomb a week would be dropped
until they surrendered unconditionally, which they did on August 14. In actuality, the United States had only enough plutonium
for one more bomb, as yet unassembled.
Knowing that fusion produces several times more energy per kilogram of fuel than fission, some scientists pursued the idea of
constructing a fusion bomb. The first such bomb was detonated by the United States several years after the first fission bombs,
on October 31, 1952, at Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. It had a yield of 10 megatons (MT), about 670 times that of the fission
bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The Soviet Union followed with a fusion device of its own in August 1953, and a weapons race,
beyond the aim of this text to discuss, continued until the end of the Cold War.
Figure 22.35 shows a simple diagram of how a thermonuclear bomb is constructed. A fission bomb is exploded next to fusion

serves to reflect some neutrons back into the fuel, causing more fusion, and it boosts the energy output by fissioning itself

when neutron energies become high enough.

Of course, not all applications of nuclear physics are as destructive as the weapons described above. Hundreds of nuclear fission
power plants around the world attest to the fact that controlled fission is both practical and economical. Given growing concerns
over global warming, nuclear power is often seen as a viable alternative to energy derived from fossil fuels.

BOUNDLESS PHYSICS
Fusion Reactors

For decades, fusion reactors have been deemed the energy of the future. A safer, cleaner, and more abundant potential source of
energy than its fission counterpart, images of the fusion reactor have been conjured up each time the need for a renewable,
environmentally friendly resource is discussed. Now, after more than half a century of speculating, some scientists believe that
fusion reactors are nearly here.
In creating energy by combining atomic nuclei, the fusion reaction holds many advantages over fission. First, fusion reactions
are more efficient, releasing 3 to 4 times more energy than fission per gram of fuel. Furthermore, unlike fission reactions that
require heavy elements like uranium that are difficult to obtain, fusion requires light elements that are abundant in nature. The
greatest advantage of the fusion reaction, however, is in its ability to be controlled. While traditional nuclear reactors create
worries about meltdowns and radioactive waste, neither is a substantial concern with the fusion reaction. Consider that fusion
reactions require a large amount of energy to overcome the repulsive Coulomb force and that the byproducts of a fusion reaction
are largely limited to helium nuclei.
In order for fusion to occur, hydrogen isotopes of deuterium and tritium must be acquired. While deuterium can easily be
gathered from ocean water, tritium is slightly more difficult to come by, though it can be manufactured from Earth’s abundant
lithium. Once acquired, the hydrogen isotopes are injected into an empty vessel and subjected to temperature and pressure
great enough to mimic the conditions at the core of our Sun. Using carefully controlled high-frequency radio waves, the
hydrogen isotopes are broken into plasma and further controlled through an electromagnetic field. As the electromagnetic field
continues to exert pressure on the hydrogen plasma, enough energy is supplied to cause the hydrogen plasma to fuse into
helium.

Once the plasma fuses, high-velocity neutrons are ejected from the newly formed helium atoms. Those high velocity neutrons,
carrying the excess energy stored within bonds of the original hydrogen, are able to travel unaffected by the applied magnetic
field. In doing so, they strike a barrier around the nuclear reactor, transforming their excess energy to heat. The heat is then
harvested to make steam that drives turbines. Hydrogen’s tremendous power is now usable!
The historical concern with nuclear fusion reactors is that the energy required to control the electromagnetic field is greater
than the energy harvested from the hydrogen atoms. However, recent research by both Lockheed Martin engineers and
scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has yielded exciting theoretical improvements in efficiency. At the
time of this writing, a test facility called ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is being constructed in
southern France. A joint venture of the European Union, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, South Korea, and India, ITER
is designed for further study into the future of nuclear fusion energy production.

Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics
Applications of nuclear physics have become an integral part of modern life. From the bone scan that detects one cancer to the
radioiodine treatment that cures another, nuclear radiation has diagnostic and therapeutic effects on medicine.

Medical Imaging
A host of medical imaging techniques employ nuclear radiation. What makes nuclear radiation so useful? First, radiation can

easily penetrate tissue; hence, it is a useful probe to monitor conditions inside the body. Second, nuclear radiation depends on
the nuclide and not on the chemical compound it is in, so that a radioactive nuclide can be put into a compound designed for
specific purposes. When that is done, the compound is said to be tagged. A tagged compound used for medical purposes is
called a radiopharmaceutical. Radiation detectors external to the body can determine the location and concentration of a
radiopharmaceutical to yield medically useful information. For example, certain drugs are concentrated in inflamed regions of
the body, and their locations can aid diagnosis and treatment as seen in Figure 22.37. Another application utilizes a
radiopharmaceutical that the body sends to bone cells, particularly those that are most active, to detect cancerous tumors or
healing points. Images can then be produced of such bone scans. Clever use of radioisotopes determines the functioning of body
organs, such as blood flow, heart muscle activity, and iodine uptake in the thyroid gland. For instance, a radioactive form of
iodine can be used to monitor the thyroid, a radioactive thallium salt can be used to follow the blood stream, and radioactive
gallium can be used for cancer imaging.

Figure 22.37 A radiopharmaceutical was used to produce this brain image of a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. Certain features are
computer enhanced. (credit: National Institutes of Health)

Once a radioactive compound has been ingested, a device like that shown in Figure 22.38 is used to monitor nuclear activity. The
device, called an Anger camera or gamma camera uses a piece of lead with holes bored through it. The gamma rays are
redirected through the collimator to narrow their beam, and are then interpreted using a device called a scintillator. The
computer analysis of detector signals produces an image. One of the disadvantages of this detection method is that there is no
depth information (i.e., it provides a two-dimensional view of the tumor as opposed to a three-dimensional view), because
radiation from any location under that detector produces a signal.

Figure 22.38 An Anger or gamma camera consists of a lead collimator and an array of detectors. Gamma rays produce light flashes in the
scintillators. The light output is converted to an electrical signal by the photomultipliers. A computer constructs an image from the detector
output.

Single-photon-emission computer tomography (SPECT) used in conjunction with a CT scanner improves on the process carried
out by the gamma camera. Figure 22.39 shows a patient in a circular array of SPECT detectors that may be stationary or rotated,
with detector output used by a computer to construct a detailed image. The spatial resolution of this technique is poor, but the
three-dimensional image created results in a marked improvement in contrast.

Positron emission tomography (or PET) scans utilize images produced by
emitters. When the emitted positron β+
encounters an electron, mutual annihilation occurs, producing two γ rays. Those rays have identical 0.511 MeV energies (the
energy comes from the destruction of an electron or positron mass) and they move directly away from each other, allowing
detectors to determine their point of origin accurately (as shown in Figure 22.40). It requires detectors on opposite sides to
simultaneously (i.e., at the same time) detect photons of 0.511 MeV energy and utilizes computer imaging techniques similar to
those in SPECT and CT scans. PET is used extensively for diagnosing brain disorders. It can note decreased metabolism in
certain regions that accompany Alzheimer’s disease. PET can also locate regions in the brain that become active when a person
carries out specific activities, such as speaking, closing his or her eyes, and so on.

Figure 22.40 A PET system takes advantage of the two identical -ray photons produced by positron-electron annihilation. The rays are
emitted in opposite directions, so that the line along which each pair is emitted is determined. Various events detected by several pairs of
detectors are then analyzed by the computer to form an accurate image.

Ionizing Radiation on the Body
We hear many seemingly contradictory things about the biological effects of ionizing radiation. It can cause cancer, burns, and
hair loss, and yet it is used to treat and even cure cancer. How do we understand such effects? Once again, there is an underlying
simplicity in nature, even in complicated biological organisms. All the effects of ionizing radiation on biological tissue can be
understood by knowing that ionizing radiation affects molecules within cells, particularly DNA molecules. Let us take a brief
look at molecules within cells and how cells operate. Cells have long, double-helical DNA molecules containing chemical
patterns called genetic codes that govern the function and processes undertaken by the cells. Damage to DNA consists of breaks
in chemical bonds or other changes in the structural features of the DNA chain, leading to changes in the genetic code. In
human cells, we can have as many as a million individual instances of damage to DNA per cell per day. The repair ability of DNA
is vital for maintaining the integrity of the genetic code and for the normal functioning of the entire organism. A cell with a
damaged ability to repair DNA, which could have been induced by ionizing radiation, can do one of the following:
• The cell can go into an irreversible state of dormancy, known as senescence.
• The cell can commit suicide, known as programmed cell death.
• The cell can go into unregulated cell division, leading to tumors and cancers.

759

760

Chapter 22 • The Atom

Since ionizing radiation damages the DNA, ionizing radiation has its greatest effect on cells that rapidly reproduce, including
most types of cancer. Thus, cancer cells are more sensitive to radiation than normal cells and can be killed by it easily. Cancer is
characterized by a malfunction of cell reproduction, and can also be caused by ionizing radiation. There is no contradiction to
say that ionizing radiation can be both a cure and a cause.

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy is effective against cancer because cancer cells reproduce rapidly and, consequently, are more sensitive to
radiation. The central problem in radiotherapy is to make the dose for cancer cells as high as possible while limiting the dose for
normal cells. The ratio of abnormal cells killed to normal cells killed is called the therapeutic ratio, and all radiotherapy
techniques are designed to enhance that ratio. Radiation can be concentrated in cancerous tissue by a number of techniques.
One of the most prevalent techniques for well-defined tumors is a geometric technique shown in Figure 22.41. A narrow beam of
radiation is passed through the patient from a variety of directions with a common crossing point in the tumor. The technique
concentrates the dose in the tumor while spreading it out over a large volume of normal tissue.

Figure 22.41 The 60Co source of -radiation is rotated around the patient so that the common crossing point is in the tumor, concentrating
the dose there. This geometric technique works for well-defined tumors.

Another use of radiation therapy is through radiopharmaceuticals. Cleverly, radiopharmaceuticals are used in cancer therapy by
tagging antibodies with radioisotopes. Those antibodies are extracted from the patient, cultured, loaded with a radioisotope,
and then returned to the patient. The antibodies are then concentrated almost entirely in the tissue they developed to fight, thus
localizing the radiation in abnormal tissue. This method is used with radioactive iodine to fight thyroid cancer. While the
therapeutic ratio can be quite high for such short-range radiation, there can be a significant dose for organs that eliminate
radiopharmaceuticals from the body, such as the liver, kidneys, and bladder. As with most radiotherapy, the technique is limited
by the tolerable amount of damage to the normal tissue.

Radiation Dosage
To quantitatively discuss the biological effects of ionizing radiation, we need a radiation dose unit that is directly related to
those effects. To do define such a unit, it is important to consider both the biological organism and the radiation itself. Knowing
that the amount of ionization is proportional to the amount of deposited energy, we define a radiation dose unit called the rad.
It 1/100 of a joule of ionizing energy deposited per kilogram of tissue, which is
22.69
For example, if a 50.0-kg person is exposed to ionizing radiation over her entire body and she absorbs 1.00 J, then her wholebody radiation dose is
22.70
If the same 1.00 J of ionizing energy were absorbed in her 2.00-kg forearm alone, then the dose to the forearm would be
22.71
and the unaffected tissue would have a zero rad dose. When calculating radiation doses, you divide the energy absorbed by the
mass of affected tissue. You must specify the affected region, such as the whole body or forearm in addition to giving the
numerical dose in rads. Although the energy per kilogram in 1 rad is small, it can still have significant effects. Since only a few eV
cause ionization, just 0.01 J of ionizing energy can create a huge number of ion pairs and have an effect at the cellular level.
The effects of ionizing radiation may be directly proportional to the dose in rads, but they also depend on the type of radiation
and the type of tissue. That is, for a given dose in rads, the effects depend on whether the radiation is , , , X-ray, or some

other type of ionizing radiation. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) relates to the amount of biological damage that can
occur from a given type of radiation and is given in Table 22.4 for several types of ionizing radiation.

Table 22.4 Relative Biological Effectiveness

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
The RBEs given in Table 22.4 are approximate, but they yield certain valuable insights.
• The eyes are more sensitive to radiation, because the cells of the lens do not repair themselves.
• Though both are neutral and have large ranges, neutrons cause more damage than rays because neutrons often cause
secondary radiation when they are captured.
• Short-range particles such as rays have a severely damaging effect to internal anatomy, as their damage is
concentrated and more difficult for the biological organism to repair. However, the skin can usually block alpha
particles from entering the body.
Can you think of any other insights from the table?
A final dose unit more closely related to the effect of radiation on biological tissue is called the roentgen equivalent man, or rem.
A combination of all factors mentioned previously, the roentgen equivalent man is defined to be the dose in rads multiplied by
the relative biological effectiveness.
22.72
The large-scale effects of radiation on humans can be divided into two categories: immediate effects and long-term effects.
Table 22.5 gives the immediate effects of whole-body exposures received in less than one day. If the radiation exposure is spread
out over more time, greater doses are needed to cause the effects listed. Any dose less than 10 rem is called a low dose, a dose 10
to 100 rem is called a moderate dose, and anything greater than 100 rem is called a high dose.

WORK IN PHYSICS
Health Physicist

Are you interested in learning more about radiation? Are you curious about studying radiation dosage levels and ensuring the
safety of the environment and people that are most closely affected by it? If so, you may be interested in becoming a health
physicist.
The field of health physics draws from a variety of science disciplines with the central aim of mitigating radiation concerns.
Those that work as health physicists have a diverse array of potential jobs available to them, including those in research,
industry, education, environmental protection, and governmental regulation. Furthermore, while the term health physicist may
lead many to think of the medical field, there are plenty of applications within the military, industrial, and energy fields as well.
As a researcher, a health physicist can further environmental studies on the effects of radiation, design instruments for more
accurate measurements, and assist in establishing valuable radiation standards. Within the energy field, a health physicsist
often acts as a manager, closely tied to all operations at all levels, from procuring appropirate equipment to monitoring health
data. Within industry, the health physicist acts as a consultant, assisting industry management in important decisions,
designing facilities, and choosing appropriate detection tools. The health physicist possesses a unique knowledge base that
allows him or her to operate in a wide variety of interesting disciplines!
To become a health physicist, it is necessary to have a background in the physical sciences. Understanding the fields of biology,
physiology, biochemistry, and genetics are all important as well. The ability to analyze and solve new problems is critical, and a
natural aptitude for science and mathematics will assist in the continued necessary training. There are two possible
certifications for health physicists: from the American Board of Health Physicists (ABHP) and the National Registry of Radiation
Protection Technologists (NRRPT).

SECTION SUMMARY
22.1 The Structure of the Atom
• Rutherford’s gold foil experiment provided evidence
that the atom is composed of a small, dense nucleus
with electrons occupying the mostly empty space
around it.
• Analysis of emission spectra shows that energy is
emitted from energized gas in discrete quantities.

• The Bohr model of the atom describes electrons existing
in discrete orbits, with discrete energies emitted and
absorbed as the electrons decrease and increase in
orbital energy.
• The energy emitted or absorbed by an electron as it
changes energy state can be determined with the
equation

activity, represented by the equation

.
• The wavelength of energy absorbed or emitted by an
electron as it changes energy state can be determined by
the equation

, where

.
• Described as an electron cloud, the quantum model of
the atom is the result of de Broglie waves and
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.

22.2 Nuclear Forces and
Radioactivity
• The structure of the nucleus is defined by its two
nucleons, the neutron and proton.
• Atomic numbers and mass numbers are used to
differentiate between various atoms and isotopes.
Those numbers can be combined into an easily
recognizable form called a nuclide.
• The size and stability of the nucleus is based upon two
forces: the electromagnetic force and strong nuclear
force.
• Radioactive decay is the alteration of the nucleus
through the emission of particles or energy.
• Alpha decay occurs when too many protons exist in the
nucleus. It results in the ejection of an alpha particle, as
.
described in the equation
• Beta decay occurs when too many neutrons (or protons)
exist in the nucleus. It results in the transmutation of a
neutron into a proton, electron, and neutrino. The decay
is expressed through the equation
. (Beta decay may also
transform a proton into a neutron.)
• Gamma decay occurs when a nucleus in an excited state
move to a more stable state, resulting in the release of a
photon. Gamma decay is represented with the equation
.
• The penetration distance of radiation depends on its
energy, charge, and type of material it encounters.

22.3 Half Life and Radiometric
Dating
• Radioactive half-life is the time it takes a sample of
nuclei to decay to half of its original amount.
• The rate of radioactive decay is defined as the sample’s

• Knowing the half-life of a radioactive isotope allows for
the process of radioactive dating to determine the age
of a material.
• If the half-life of a material is known, the age of the
material can be found using the equation
.
• The age of organic material can be determined using the
decay of the carbon-14 isotope, while the age of rocks
can be determined using the decay of uranium-238.

22.4 Nuclear Fission and Fusion
• Nuclear fission is the splitting of an atomic bond,
releasing a large amount of potential energy previously
holding the atom together. The amount of energy
released can be determined through the equation
.
• Nuclear fusion is the combining, or fusing together, of
two nuclei. Energy is also released in nuclear fusion as
the combined nuclei are closer together, resulting in a
decreased strong nuclear force.
• Fission was used in two nuclear weapons at the
conclusion of World War II: the gun-type uranium
bomb and the implosion-type plutonium bomb.
• While fission has been used in both nuclear weapons
and nuclear reactors, fusion is capable of releasing
more energy per reaction. As a result, fusion is a wellresearched, if not yet well-controlled, energy source.

22.5 Medical Applications of
Radioactivity: Diagnostic Imaging
and Radiation
• Medical imaging occurs when a radiopharmaceutical
placed in the body provides information to an array of
radiation detectors outside the body.
• Devices utilizing medical imaging include the Anger
camera, SPECT detector, and PET scan.
• Ionizing radiation can both cure and cause cancer
through the manipulation of DNA molecules.
• Radiation dosage and its effect on the body can be
measured using the quantities radiation dose unit (rad),
relative biological effectiveness (RBE), and the roentgen
equivalent man (rem).

23.3 The Unification of Forces

INTRODUCTION Following ideas remarkably similar to those of the ancient Greeks, we continue to look for smaller and
smaller structures in nature, hoping ultimately to find and understand the most fundamental building blocks that exist. Atomic
physics deals with the smallest units of elements and compounds. In its study, we have found a relatively small number of atoms
with systematic properties, and these properties have explained a tremendous range of phenomena. Nuclear physics is
concerned with the nuclei of atoms and their substructures. Here, a smaller number of components—the proton and
neutron—make up all nuclei. Exploring the systematic behavior of their interactions has revealed even more about matter,
forces, and energy. Particle physics deals with the substructures of atoms and nuclei and is particularly aimed at finding those
truly fundamental particles that have no further substructure. Just as in atomic and nuclear physics, we have found a complex
array of particles and properties with systematic characteristics analogous to the periodic table and the chart of nuclides. An
underlying structure is apparent, and there is some reason to think that we are finding particles that have no substructure. Of
course, we have been in similar situations before. For example, atoms were once thought to be the ultimate substructures. It is
possible that we could continue to find deeper and deeper structures without ever discovering the ultimate substructure—in
science there is never complete certainty. See Figure 23.2.
The properties of matter are based on substructures called molecules and atoms. Each atom has the substructure of a nucleus
surrounded by electrons, and their interactions explain atomic properties. Protons and neutrons—and the interactions between
them—explain the stability and abundance of elements and form the substructure of nuclei. Protons and neutrons are not
fundamental—they are composed of quarks. Like electrons and a few other particles, quarks may be the fundamental building
blocks of all matter, lacking any further substructure. But the story is not complete because quarks and electrons may have
substructures smaller than details that are presently observable.

This chapter covers the basics of particle physics as we know it today. An amazing convergence of topics is evolving in particle
physics. We find that some particles are intimately related to forces and that nature on the smallest scale may have its greatest
influence on the large scale character of the universe. It is an adventure exceeding the best science fiction because it is not only
fantastic but also real.

Despite the apparent complexity within the universe, there remain just four basic forces. These forces are responsible for all
interactions known to science: from the very small to the very large to those that we experience in our day-to-day lives. These
forces describe the movement of galaxies, the chemical reactions in our laboratories, the structure within atomic nuclei, and the
cause of radioactive decay. They describe the true cause behind familiar terms like friction and the normal force. These four
basic forces are known as fundamental because they alone are responsible for all observations of forces in nature. The four
fundamental forces are gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force.

Understanding the Four Forces
The gravitational force is most familiar to us because it describes so many of our common observations. It explains why a
dropped ball falls to the ground and why our planet orbits the Sun. It gives us the property of weight and determines much
about the motion of objects in our daily lives. Because gravitational force acts between all objects of mass and has the ability to
act over large distances, the gravitational force can be used to explain much of what we observe and can even describe the
motion of objects on astronomical scales! That said, gravity is incredibly weak compared to the other fundamental forces and is
the weakest of all of the fundamental forces. Consider this: The entire mass of Earth is needed to hold an iron nail to the ground.
Yet with a simple magnet, the force of gravity can be overcome, allowing the nail to accelerate upward through space.
The electromagnetic force is responsible for both electrostatic interactions and the magnetic force seen between bar magnets.
When focusing on the electrostatic relationship between two charged particles, the electromagnetic force is known as the
coulomb force. The electromagnetic force is an important force in the chemical and biological sciences, as it is responsible for
molecular connections like ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding. Additionally, the electromagnetic force is behind the common
physics forces of friction and the normal force. Like the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force is an inverse square law.
However, the electromagnetic force does not exist between any two objects of mass, only those that are charged.
When considering the structure of an atom, the electromagnetic force is somewhat apparent. After all, the electrons are held in
place by an attractive force from the nucleus. But what causes the nucleus to remain intact? After all, if all protons are positive, it

Access for free at openstax.org.

23.1 • The Four Fundamental Forces

makes sense that the coulomb force between the protons would repel the nucleus apart immediately. Scientists theorized that
another force must exist within the nucleus to keep it together. They further theorized that this nuclear force must be
significantly stronger than gravity, which has been observed and measured for centuries, and also stronger than the
electromagnetic force, which would cause the protons to want to accelerate away from each other.
The strong nuclear force is an attractive force that exists between all nucleons. This force, which acts equally between protonproton connections, proton-neutron connections, and neutron-neutron connections, is the strongest of all forces at short
ranges. However, at a distance of 10–13 cm, or the diameter of a single proton, the force dissipates to zero. If the nucleus is large
(it has many nucleons), then the distance between each nucleon could be much larger than the diameter of a single proton.
Recall that beta
The weak nuclear force is responsible for beta decay, as seen in the equation
decay is when a beta particle is ejected from an atom. In order to accelerate away from the nucleus, the particle must be acted on
by a force. Enrico Fermi was the first to envision this type of force. While this force is appropriately labeled, it remains stronger
than the gravitational force. However, its range is even smaller than that of the strong force, as can be seen in Table 23.1. The
weak nuclear force is more important than it may appear at this time, as will be addressed when we discuss quarks.

Transmitting the Four Fundamental Forces
Just as it troubled Einstein prior to formulating the gravitational field theory, the concept of forces acting over a distance had
greatly troubled particle physicists. That is, how does one proton know that another exists? Furthermore, what causes one
proton to make a second proton repel? Or, for that matter, what is it about a proton that causes a neutron to attract? These
mysterious interactions were first considered by Hideki Yukawa in 1935 and laid the foundation for much of what we now
understand about particle physics.
Hideki Yukawa’s focus was on the strong nuclear force and, in particular, its incredibly short range. His idea was a blend of
particles, relativity, and quantum mechanics that was applicable to all four forces. Yukawa proposed that the nuclear force is
actually transmitted by the exchange of particles, called carrier particles, and that what we commonly refer to as the force’s field
consists of these carrier particles. Specifically for the strong nuclear force, Yukawa proposed that a previously unknown particle,
called a pion, is exchanged between nucleons, transmitting the force between them. Figure 23.3 illustrates how a pion would
carry a force between a proton and a neutron.

Figure 23.3 The strong nuclear force is transmitted between a proton and neutron by the creation and exchange of a pion. The pion,
created through a temporary violation of conservation of mass-energy, travels from the proton to the neutron and is recaptured. It is not

773

774

Chapter 23 • Particle Physics

directly observable and is called a virtual particle. Note that the proton and neutron change identity in the process. The range of the force is
limited by the fact that the pion can exist for only the short time allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Yukawa used the finite
range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion; the shorter the range, the larger the mass of the carrier particle.

In Yukawa’s strong force, the carrier particle is assumed to be transmitted at the speed of light and is continually transferred
between the two nucleons shown. The particle that Yukawa predicted was finally discovered within cosmic rays in 1947. Its name,
the pion, stands for pi meson, where meson means medium mass; it’s a medium mass because it is smaller than a nucleon but
larger than an electron. Yukawa launched the field that is now called quantum chromodynamics, and the carrier particles are
now called gluons due to their strong binding power. The reason for the change in the particle name will be explained when
quarks are discussed later in this section.
As you may assume, the strong force is not the only force with a carrier particle. Nuclear decay from the weak force also requires
a particle transfer. In the weak force are the following three: the weak negative carrier, W–; the weak positive carrier, W+; and the
zero charge carrier, Z0. As we will see, Fermi inferred that these particles must carry mass, as the total mass of the products of
nuclear decay is slightly larger than the total mass of all reactants after nuclear decay.
The carrier particle for the electromagnetic force is, not surprisingly, the photon. After all, just as a lightbulb can emit photons
from a charged tungsten filament, the photon can be used to transfer information from one electrically charged particle to
another. Finally, the graviton is the proposed carrier particle for gravity. While it has not yet been found, scientists are currently
looking for evidence of its existence (see Boundless Physics: Searching for the Graviton).
So how does a carrier particle transmit a fundamental force? Figure 23.4 shows a virtual photon transmitted from one positively
charged particle to another. The transmitted photon is referred to as a virtual particle because it cannot be directly observed
while transmitting the force. Figure 23.5 shows a way of graphing the exchange of a virtual photon between the two positively
charged particles. This graph of time versus position is called a Feynman diagram, after the brilliant American physicist Richard
Feynman (1918–1988), who developed it.

Figure 23.4 The image in part (a) shows the exchange of a virtual photon transmitting the electromagnetic force between charges, just as
virtual pion exchange carries the strong nuclear force between nucleons. The image in part (b) shows that the photon cannot be directly
observed in its passage because this would disrupt it and alter the force. In this case, the photon does not reach the other charge.

The Feynman diagram should be read from the bottom up to show the movement of particles over time. In it, you can see that
the left proton is propelled leftward from the photon emission, while the right proton feels an impulse to the right when the
photon is received. In addition to the Feynman diagram, Richard Feynman was one of the theorists who developed the field of
quantum electrodynamics (QED), which further describes electromagnetic interactions on the submicroscopic scale. For this
work, he shared the 1965 Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and S.I. Tomonaga. A Feynman diagram explaining the strong force
interaction hypothesized by Yukawa can be seen in Figure 23.6. Here, you can see the change in particle type due to the exchange
of the pi meson.

electromagnetic force is transmitted on a quantum mechanical scale. Time is graphed vertically, while the distance is graphed horizontally.
The two positively charged particles are seen to repel each other by the photon exchange.

Figure 23.6 The image shows a Feynman diagram for the exchange of a π+ (pion) between a proton and a neutron, carrying the strong
nuclear force between them. This diagram represents the situation shown more pictorially in Figure 23.3.

The relative masses of the listed carrier particles describe something valuable about the four fundamental forces, as can be seen
in Table 23.2. W bosons (consisting of
and
bosons) and Z bosons (
bosons), carriers of the weak nuclear force, are
nearly 1,000 times more massive than pions, carriers of the strong nuclear force. Simultaneously, the distance that the weak
times the strong force transmission distance. Unlike carrier particles,
nuclear force can be transmitted is approximately
which have a limited range, the photon is a massless particle that has no limit to the transmission distance of the
electromagnetic force. This relationship leads scientists to understand that the yet-unfound graviton is likely massless as well.

Searching for the Graviton

From Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation to Einstein’s field equations, gravitation has held the focus of scientists for
centuries. Given the discovery of carrier particles during the twentieth century, the importance of understanding gravitation
has yet again gained the interest of prominent physicists everywhere.
With carrier particles discovered for three of the four fundamental forces, it is sensible to scientists that a similar particle, titled
the graviton, must exist for the gravitational force. While evidence of this particle is yet to be uncovered, scientists are working
diligently to discover its existence.
So what do scientists think about the unfound particle? For starters, the graviton (like the photon) should be a massless particle
traveling at the speed of light. This is assumed because, like the electromagnetic force, gravity is an inverse square law,
.
Scientists also theorize that the graviton is an electrically neutral particle, as an empty space within the influence of gravity is
chargeless.
However, because gravity is such a weak force, searching for the graviton has resulted in some unique methods. LIGO, the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is one tool currently being utilized (see Figure 23.7). While searching for a
gravitational wave to find a carrier particle may seem counterintuitive, it is similar to the approach taken by Planck and Einstein
to learn more about the photon. According to wave-particle duality, if a gravitational wave can be found, the graviton should be
present along with it. Predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, scientists have been monitoring binary star systems for
evidence of these gravitational waves.

Figure 23.7 In searching for gravitational waves, scientists are using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Here
we see the control room of LIGO in Hanford, Washington.

Particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are being used to search for the graviton through high-energy
collisions. While scientists at the LHC speculate that the particle may not exist long enough to be seen, evidence of its prior
existence, like footprints in the sand, can be found through gaps in projected energy and momentum.
Some scientists are even searching the remnants of the Big Bang in an attempt to find the graviton. By observing the cosmic
background radiation, they are looking for anomalies in gravitational waves that would provide information about the gravity
particles that existed at the start of our universe.
Regardless of the method used, scientists should know the graviton once they find it. A massless, chargeless particle with a spin
of 2 and traveling at the speed of light—there is no other particle like it. Should it be found, its discovery would surely be
considered by future generations to be on par with those of Newton and Einstein.
GRASP CHECK
Why are binary star systems used by LIGO to find gravitational waves?
a. Binary star systems have high temperature.
b. Binary star systems have low density.
c. Binary star systems contain a large amount of mass, but because they are orbiting each other, the gravitational field
between the two is much less.
d. Binary star systems contain a large amount of mass. As a result, the gravitational field between the two is great.

23.1 • The Four Fundamental Forces

Accelerators Create Matter From Energy
Before looking at all the particles that make up our universe, let us first examine some of the machines that create them. The
fundamental process in creating unknown particles is to accelerate known particles, such as protons or electrons, and direct a
beam of them toward a target. Collisions with target nuclei provide a wealth of information, such as information obtained by
Rutherford in the gold foil experiment. If the energy of the incoming particles is large enough, new matter can even be created
in the collision. The more energy input or ΔE, the more matter m can be created, according to mass energy equivalence
. Limitations are placed on what can occur by known conservation laws, such as conservation of mass-energy,
momentum, and charge. Even more interesting are the unknown limitations provided by nature. While some expected
reactions do occur, others do not, and still other unexpected reactions may appear. New laws are revealed, and the vast majority
of what we know about particle physics has come from accelerator laboratories. It is the particle physicist’s favorite indoor
sport.
Our earliest model of a particle accelerator comes from the Van de Graaff generator. The relatively simple device, which you have
likely seen in physics demonstrations, can be manipulated to produce potentials as great as 50 million volts. While these
machines do not have energies large enough to produce new particles, analysis of their accelerated ions was instrumental in
exploring several aspects of the nucleus.
Another equally famous early accelerator is the cyclotron, invented in 1930 by the American physicist, E.O. Lawrence
(1901–1958). Figure 23.8 is a visual representation with more detail. Cyclotrons use fixed-frequency alternating electric fields to
accelerate particles. The particles spiral outward in a magnetic field, making increasingly larger radius orbits during
acceleration. This clever arrangement allows the successive addition of electric potential energy with each loop. As a result,
greater particle energies are possible than in a Van de Graaff generator.

Figure 23.8 On the left is an artist’s rendition of the popular physics demonstration tool, the Van de Graaff generator. A battery (A) supplies
excess positive charge to a pointed conductor, the points of which spray the charge onto a moving insulating belt near the bottom. The
pointed conductor (B) on top in the large sphere picks up the charge. (The induced electric field at the points is so large that it removes the
charge from the belt.) This can be done because the charge does not remain inside the conducting sphere but moves to its outer surface. An
ion source inside the sphere produces positive ions, which are accelerated away from the positive sphere to high velocities. On the right is a
cyclotron. Cyclotrons use a magnetic field to cause particles to move in circular orbits. As the particles pass between the plates of the Dees,
the voltage across the gap is oscillated to accelerate them twice in each orbit.

A synchrotron is a modification of the cyclotron in which particles continually travel in a fixed-radius orbit, increasing speed
each time. Accelerating voltages are synchronized with the particles to accelerate them, hence the name. Additionally, magnetic
field strength is increased to keep the orbital radius constant as energy increases. A ring of magnets and accelerating tubes, as
shown in Figure 23.9, are the major components of synchrotrons. High-energy particles require strong magnetic fields to steer

777

778

Chapter 23 • Particle Physics

them, so superconducting magnets are commonly employed. Still limited by achievable magnetic field strengths, synchrotrons
need to be very large at very high energies since the radius of a high-energy particle’s orbit is very large.
To further probe the nucleus, physicists need accelerators of greater energy and detectors of shorter wavelength. To do so
requires not only greater funding but greater ingenuity as well. Colliding beams used at both the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory (Fermilab; see Figure 23.11) near Chicago and the LHC in Switzerland are designed to reduce energy loss in particle
collisions. Typical stationary particle detectors lose a large amount of energy to the recoiling target struck by the accelerating
particle. By providing head-on collisions between particles moving in opposite directions, colliding beams make it possible to
create particles with momenta and kinetic energies near zero. This allows for particles of greater energy and mass to be created.
Figure 23.10 is a schematic representation of this effect. In addition to circular accelerators, linear accelerators can be used to
reduce energy radiation losses. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (now called the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory) in
California is home to the largest such accelerator in the world.

Figure 23.9 (a) A synchrotron has a ring of magnets and accelerating tubes. The frequency of the accelerating voltages is increased to
cause the beam particles to travel the same distance in a shorter time. The magnetic field should also be increased to keep each beam
burst traveling in a fixed-radius path. Limits on magnetic field strength require these machines to be very large in order to accelerate
particles to very high energies. (b) A positively charged particle is shown in the gap between accelerating tubes. (c) While the particle
passes through the tube, the potentials are reversed so that there is another acceleration at the next gap. The frequency of the reversals
needs to be varied as the particle is accelerated to achieve successive accelerations in each gap.

Figure 23.10 This schematic shows the two rings of Fermilab’s accelerator and the scheme for colliding protons and antiprotons (not to
scale).

Figure 23.11 The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, near Batavia, Illinois, was a subatomic particle collider that accelerated protons
and antiprotons to attain energies up to 1 Tev (a trillion electronvolts). The circular ponds near the rings were built to dissipate waste heat.

“The first principles of the universe are atoms and empty space. Everything else is merely thought to exist…”
“… Further, the atoms are unlimited in size and number, and they are borne along with the whole universe in a vortex, and
thereby generate all composite things—fire, water, air, earth. For even these are conglomerations of given atoms. And it because
of their solidity that these atoms are impassive and unalterable.”
—Diogenes Laertius (summarizing the views of Democritus, circa 460–370 B.C.)
The search for fundamental particles is nothing new. Atomists of the Greek and Indian empires, like Democritus of fifth century
B.C., openly wondered about the most finite components of our universe. Though dormant for centuries, curiosity about the
atomic nature of matter was reinvigorated by Rutherford’s gold foil experiment and the discovery of the nucleus. By the early
1930s, scientists believed they had fully determined the tiniest constituents of matter—in the form of the proton, neutron, and
electron.
This would be only partially true. At present, scientists know that there are hundreds of particles not unlike our electron and
nucleons, all making up what some have termed the particle zoo. While we are confident that the electron remains
fundamental, it is surrounded by a plethora of similar sounding terms, like leptons, hadrons, baryons, and mesons. Even
though not every particle is considered fundamental, they all play a vital role in understanding the intricate structure of our
universe.
A fundamental particle is defined as a particle with no substructure and no finite size. According to the Standard Model, there
are three types of fundamental particles: leptons, quarks, and carrier particles. As you may recall, carrier particles are
responsible for transmitting fundamental forces between their interacting masses. Leptons are a group of six particles not
bound by the strong nuclear force, of which the electron is one. As for quarks, they are the fundamental building blocks of a
group of particles called hadrons, a group that includes both the proton and the neutron.
Now for a brief history of quarks. Quarks were first proposed independently by American physicists Murray Gell-Mann and
George Zweig in 1963. Originally, three quark types—or flavors—were proposed with the names up (u), down (d), and strange
(s).
At first, physicists expected that, with sufficient energy, we should be able to free quarks and observe them directly. However,
this has not proved possible, as the current understanding is that the force holding quarks together is incredibly great and,
much like a spring, increases in magnitude as the quarks are separated. As a result, when large energies are put into collisions,
other particles are created—but no quarks emerge. With that in mind, there is compelling evidence for the existence of quarks.
By 1967, experiments at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory scattering 20-GeV electrons from protons produced results
like Rutherford had obtained for the nucleus nearly 60 years earlier. The SLAC scattering experiments showed unambiguously
that there were three point-like (meaning they had sizes considerably smaller than the probe’s wavelength) charges inside the
proton as seen in Figure 23.12. This evidence made all but the most skeptical admit that there was validity to the quark
substructure of hadrons.

Figure 23.12 Scattering of high-energy electrons from protons at facilities like SLAC produces evidence of three point-like charges
consistent with proposed quark properties. This experiment is analogous to Rutherford’s discovery of the small size of the nucleus by
scattering α particles. High-energy electrons are used so that the probe wavelength is small enough to see details smaller than the proton.

The inclusion of the strange quark with Zweig and Gell-Mann’s model concerned physicists. While the up and down quarks
demonstrated fairly clear symmetry and were present in common fundamental particles like protons and neutrons, the strange
quark did not have a counterpart of its own. This thought, coupled with the four known leptons at the time, caused scientists to
predict that a fourth quark, yet to be found, also existed.
In 1974, two groups of physicists independently discovered a particle with this new quark, labeled charmed. This completed the
second exotic quark pair, strange (s) and charmed (c). A final pair of quarks was proposed when a third pair of leptons was
discovered in 1975. The existence of the bottom (b) quark and the top (t) quark was verified through experimentation in 1976 and
1995, respectively. While it may seem odd that so much time would elapse between the original quark discovery in 1967 and the
verification of the top quark in 1995, keep in mind that each quark discovered had a progressively larger mass. As a result, each
new quark has required more energy to discover.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Note that a very important tenet of science occurred throughout the period of quark discovery. The charmed, bottom, and
top quarks were all speculated on, and then were discovered some time later. Each of their discoveries helped to verify and
strengthen the quark model. This process of speculation and verification continues to take place today and is part of what
drives physicists to search for evidence of the graviton and Grand Unified Theory.
One of the most confounding traits of quarks is their electric charge. Long assumed to be discrete, and specifically a multiple of
the elementary charge of the electron, the electric charge of an individual quark is fractional and thus seems to violate a
presumed tenet of particle physics. The fractional charge of quarks, which are
and
, are the only structures
found in nature with a nonintegral number of charge . However, note that despite this odd construction, the fractional value
of the quark does not violate the quantum nature of the charge. After all, free quarks cannot be found in nature, and all quarks
are bound into arrangements in which an integer number of charge is constructed. Table 23.3 shows the six known quarks, in
addition to their antiquark components, as will be discussed later in this section.

Table 23.3 Quarks and Antiquarks
While the term flavor is used to differentiate between types of quarks, the concept of color is more analogous to the electric
charge in that it is primarily responsible for the force interactions between quarks. Note—Take a moment to think about the
electrostatic force. It is the electric charge that causes attraction and repulsion. It is the same case here but with a color charge.
The three colors available to a quark are red, green, and blue, with antiquarks having colors of anti-red (or cyan), anti-green (or
magenta), and anti-blue (or yellow).
Why use colors when discussing quarks? After all, the quarks are not actually colored with visible light. The reason colors are
used is because the properties of a quark are analogous to the three primary and secondary colors mentioned above. Just as
different colors of light can be combined to create white, different colors of quark may be combined to construct a particle like a
proton or neutron. In fact, for each hadron, the quarks must combine such that their color sums to white! Recall that two up
quarks and one down quark construct a proton, as seen in Figure 23.12. The sum of the three quarks’ colors—red, green, and
blue—yields the color white. This theory of color interaction within particles is called quantum chromodynamics, or QCD. As
part of QCD, the strong nuclear force can be explained using color. In fact, some scientists refer to the color force, not the strong
force, as one of the four fundamental forces. Figure 23.13 is a Feynman diagram showing the interaction between two quarks by
using the transmission of a colored gluon. Note that the gluon is also considered the charge carrier for the strong nuclear force.

Figure 23.13 The exchange of gluons between quarks carries the strong force and may change the color of the interacting quarks. While the
colors of the individual quarks change, their flavors do not.

Note that quark flavor may have any color. For instance, in Figure 23.13, the down quark has a red color and a green color. In
other words, colors are not specific to a particle quark flavor.

Hadrons and Leptons
Particles can be revealingly grouped according to what forces they feel between them. All particles (even those that are massless)
are affected by gravity since gravity affects the space and time in which particles exist. All charged particles are affected by the
electromagnetic force, as are neutral particles that have an internal distribution of charge (such as the neutron with its magnetic
moment). Special names are given to particles that feel the strong and weak nuclear forces. Hadrons are particles that feel the
strong nuclear force, whereas leptons are particles that do not. All particles feel the weak nuclear force. This means that hadrons
are distinguished by being able to feel both the strong and weak nuclear forces. Leptons and hadrons are distinguished in other
ways as well. Leptons are fundamental particles that have no measurable size, while hadrons are composed of quarks and have a
diameter on the order of 10 to 15 m. Six particles, including the electron and neutrino, make up the list of known leptons. There
are hundreds of complex particles in the hadron class, a few of which (including the proton and neutron) are listed in Table 23.4.

There are many more leptons, mesons, and baryons yet to be discovered and measured. The purpose of trying to uncover the
smallest indivisible things in existence is to explain the world around us through forces and the interactions between particles,
galaxies and objects. This is why a handful of scientists devote their life’s work to smashing together small particles.
What internal structure makes a proton so different from an electron? The proton, like all hadrons, is made up of quarks. A few
examples of hadron quark composition can be seen in Figure 23.14. As shown, each hadron is constructed of multiple quarks. As
mentioned previously, the fractional quark charge in all four hadrons sums to the particle’s integral value. Also, notice that the
color composition for each of the four particles adds to white. Each of the particles shown is constructed of up, down, and their
antiquarks. This is not surprising, as the quarks strange, charmed, top, and bottom are found in only our most exotic particles.

Chapter 23 • Particle Physics

Figure 23.14 All baryons, such as the proton and neutron shown here, are composed of three quarks. All mesons, such as the pions shown
here, are composed of a quark–antiquark pair. Arrows represent the spins of the quarks. The colors are such that they need to add to white
for any possible combination of quarks.

You may have noticed that while the proton and neutron in Figure 23.14 are composed of three quarks, both pions are comprised
of only two quarks. This refers to a final delineation in particle structure. Particles with three quarks are called baryons. These
are heavy particles that can decay into another baryon. Particles with only two quarks—a-quark–anti-quark pair—are called
mesons. These are particles of moderate mass that cannot decay into the more massive baryons.
Before continuing, take a moment to view Figure 23.15. In this figure, you can see the strong force reimagined as a color force.
The particles interacting in this figure are the proton and neutron, just as they were in Figure 23.6. This reenvisioning of the
strong force as an interaction between colored quarks is the critical concept behind quantum chromodynamics.

Figure 23.15 This Feynman diagram shows the interaction between a proton and a neutron, corresponding to the interaction shown in
Figure 23.6. This diagram, however, shows the quark and gluon details of the strong nuclear force interaction.

Matter and Antimatter
Antimatter was first discovered in the form of the positron, the positively charged electron. In 1932, American physicist Carl
Anderson discovered the positron in cosmic ray studies. Through a cloud chamber modified to curve the trajectories of cosmic

Access for free at openstax.org.

23.2 • Quarks

rays, Anderson noticed that the curves of some particles followed that of a negative charge, while others curved like a positive
charge. However, the positive curve showed not the mass of a proton but the mass of an electron. This outcome is shown in
Figure 23.16 and suggests the existence of a positively charged version of the electron, created by the destruction of solar
photons.

Figure 23.16 The image above is from the Fermilab 15 foot bubble chamber and shows the production of an electron and positron (or
antielectron) from an incident photon. This event is titled pair production and provides evidence of antimatter, as the two repel each other.

Antimatter is considered the opposite of matter. For most antiparticles, this means that they share the same properties as their
original particles with the exception of their charge. This is why the positron can be considered a positive electron while the
antiproton is considered a negative proton. The idea of an opposite charge for neutral particles (like the neutron) can be
confusing, but it makes sense when considered from the quark perspective. Just as the neutron is composed of one up quark and
two down quarks (of charge
and
, respectively), the antineutron is composed of one anti–up quark and two anti–down
quarks (of charge

and

, respectively). While the overall charge of the neutron remains the same, its constituent particles

do not!
A word about antiparticles: Like regular particles, antiparticles could function just fine on their own. In fact, a universe made up
of antimatter may operate just as our own matter-based universe does. However, we do not know fully whether this is the case.
The reason for this is annihilation. Annihilation is the process of destruction that occurs when a particle and its antiparticle
interact. As soon as two particles (like a positron and an electron) coincide, they convert their masses to energy through the
. This mass-to-energy conversion, which typically results in photon release, happens instantaneously and
equation
makes it very difficult for scientists to study antimatter. That said, scientists have had success creating antimatter through highenergy particle collisions. Both antineutrons and antiprotons were created through accelerator experiments in 1956, and an
anti–hydrogen atom was even created at CERN in 1995! As referenced in , the annihilation of antiparticles is currently used in
medical studies to determine the location of radioisotopes.

Completing the Standard Model of the Atom
The Standard Model of the atom refers to the current scientific view of the fundamental components and interacting forces of
matter. The Standard Model (Figure 23.17) shows the six quarks that bind to form all hadrons, the six lepton particles already
considered fundamental, the four carrier particles (or gauge bosons) that transmit forces between the leptons and quarks, and
the recently added Higgs boson (which will be discussed shortly). This totals 17 fundamental particles, combinations of which
are responsible for all known matter in our entire universe! When adding the antiquarks and antileptons, 31 components make
up the Standard Model.

785

786

Chapter 23 • Particle Physics

Figure 23.17 The Standard Model of elementary particles shows an organized view of all fundamental particles, as currently known: six
quarks, six leptons, and four gauge bosons (or carrier particles). The Higgs boson, first observed in 2012, is a new addition to the Standard
Model.

Figure 23.17 shows all particles within the Standard Model of the atom. Not only does this chart divide all known particles by
color-coded group, but it also provides information on particle stability. Note that the color-coding system in this chart is
separate from the red, green, and blue color labeling system of quarks. The first three columns represent the three families of
matter. The first column, considered Family 1, represents particles that make up normal matter, constructing the protons,
neutrons, and electrons that make up the common world. Family 2, represented from the charm quark to the muon neutrino, is
comprised of particles that are more massive. The leptons in this group are less stable and more likely to decay. Family 3,
represented by the third column, are more massive still and decay more quickly. The order of these families also conveniently
represents the order in which these particles were discovered.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Look for trends that exist within the Standard Model. Compare the charge of each particle. Compare the spin. How does
mass relate to the model structure? Recognizing each of these trends and asking questions will yield more insight into the
organization of particles and the forces that dictate particle relationships. Our understanding of the Standard Model is still
young, and the questions you may have in analyzing the Standard Model may be some of the same questions that particle
physicists are searching for answers to today!
The Standard Model also summarizes the fundamental forces that exist as particles interact. A closer look at the Standard
Model, as shown in Figure 23.18, reveals that the arrangement of carrier particles describes these interactions.

23.2 • Quarks

Figure 23.18 The revised Standard Model shows the interaction between gauge bosons and other fundamental particles. These
interactions are responsible for the fundamental forces, three of which are described through the chart’s shaded areas.

Each of the shaded areas represents a fundamental force and its constituent particles. The red shaded area shows all particles
involved in the strong nuclear force, which we now know is due to quantum chromodynamics. The blue shaded area corresponds
to the electromagnetic force, while the green shaded area corresponds to the weak nuclear force, which affects all quarks and
leptons. The electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force are considered united by the electroweak force within the Standard
Model. Also, because definitive evidence of the graviton is yet to be found, it is not included in the Standard Model.

The Higgs Boson
One interesting feature of the Standard Model shown in Figure 23.18 is that, while the gluon and photon have no mass, the Z and
W bosons are very massive. What supplies these quickly moving particles with mass and not the gluons and photons?
Furthermore, what causes some quarks to have more mass than others?
In the 1960s, British physicist Peter Higgs and others speculated that the W and Z bosons were actually just as massless as the
gluon and photon. However, as the W and Z bosons traveled from one particle to another, they were slowed down by the
presence of a Higgs field, much like a fish swimming through water. The thinking was that the existence of the Higgs field
would slow down the bosons, causing them to decrease in energy and thereby transfer this energy to mass. Under this theory, all
particles pass through the Higgs field, which exists throughout the universe. The gluon and photon travel through this field as
well but are able to do so unaffected.
The presence of a force from the Higgs field suggests the existence of its own carrier particle, the Higgs boson. This theorized
boson interacts with all particles but gluons and photons, transferring force from the Higgs field. Particles with large mass (like
the top quark) are more likely to receive force from the Higgs boson.
While it is difficult to examine a field, it is somewhat simpler to find evidence of its carrier. On July 4, 2012, two groups of
scientists at the LHC independently confirmed the existence of a Higgs-like particle. By examining trillions of proton–proton
collisions at energies of 7 to 8 TeV, LHC scientists were able to determine the constituent particles that created the protons. In
this data, scientists found a particle with similar mass, spin, parity, and interactions with other particles that matched the
Higgs boson predicted decades prior. On March 13, 2013, the existence of the Higgs boson was tentatively confirmed by CERN.
Peter Higgs and Francois Englert received the Nobel Prize in 2013 for the “theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes
to our understanding of the origin and mass of subatomic particles.”

the expertise of particle physicists. College teaching and research positions can also be potential career opportunities for
particle physicists, though they often require some postgraduate work as a prerequisite. In addition, many particle physicists
are employed to work on high-energy colliders. Domestic collider labs include the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York,
the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory operated by Stanford

Shirley Jackson became the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D. from MIT back in 1973, and she went on to lead a

strong curiosity in the world around them and a drive to continually learn more. If you are interested in exploring a career in
particle physics, work to achieve good grades and SAT scores, and find time to read popular books on physics topics that interest
you. While some math may be challenging, recognize that this is only a tool of physics and should not be considered prohibitive
to the field. High-level work in particle physics often requires a Ph.D.; however, it is possible to find work with a master’s

Understanding the Grand Unified Theory
Present quests to show that the four basic forces are different manifestations of a single unified force that follow a long
tradition. In the nineteenth century, the distinct electric and magnetic forces were shown to be intimately connected and are
now collectively called the electromagnetic force. More recently, the weak nuclear force was united with the electromagnetic
force. As shown in Figure 23.19, carrier particles transmit three of the four fundamental forces in very similar ways. With these
considerations in mind, it is natural to suggest that a theory may be constructed in which the strong nuclear, weak nuclear, and
electromagnetic forces are all unified. The search for a correct theory linking the forces, called the Grand Unified Theory (GUT),
is explored in this section.
In the 1960s, the electroweak theory was developed by Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow, and Abdus Salam. This theory
proposed that the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are identical at sufficiently high energies. At lower energies, like
those in our present-day universe, the two forces remain united but manifest themselves in different ways. One of the main
consequences of the electroweak theory was the prediction of three short-range carrier particles, now known as the
and
bosons. Not only were three particles predicted, but the mass of each
and
boson was predicted to be 81 GeV/c2,
2
and that of the
boson was predicted to be 90 GeV/c . In 1983, these carrier particles were observed at CERN with the
predicted characteristics, including masses having those predicted values as given in .
How can forces be unified? They are definitely distinct under most circumstances. For example, they are carried by different
particles and have greatly different strengths. But experiments show that at extremely short distances and at extremely high
energies, the strengths of the forces begin to become more similar, as seen in Figure 23.20.

Figure 23.19 The exchange of a virtual

particle (boson) carries the weak nuclear force between an electron and a neutrino in this

Feynman diagram. This diagram is similar to the diagrams in Figure 23.6 and for the electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces.

As discussed earlier, the short ranges and large masses of the weak carrier bosons require correspondingly high energies to
create them. Thus, the energy scale on the horizontal axis of Figure 23.20 also corresponds to shorter and shorter distances

Access for free at openstax.org.

23.3 • The Unification of Forces

(going from left to right), with 100 GeV corresponding to approximately 10−18 m, for example. At that distance, the strengths of
the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are the same. To test this, energies of about 100 GeV are put into the system. When
this occurs, the
,
, and
carrier particles are created and released. At those and higher energies, the masses of the
carrier particles become less and less relevant, and the
boson in particular resembles the massless, chargeless photon. As
,
, and
particles are further transformed into massless carrier particles even more
further energy is added, the
similar to photons and gluons.

Figure 23.20 The relative strengths of the four basic forces vary with distance, and, hence, energy is needed to probe small distances. At
ordinary energies (a few eV or less), the forces differ greatly. However, at energies available in accelerators, the weak nuclear and
electromagnetic (EM) forces become unified. Unfortunately, the energies at which the strong nuclear and electroweak forces become the
same are unreachable in any conceivable accelerator. The universe may provide a laboratory, and nature may show effects at ordinary
energies that give us clues about the validity of this graph.

The extremely short distances and high energies at which the electroweak force becomes identical with the strong nuclear force
are not reachable with any conceivable human-built accelerator. At energies of about 1014 GeV (16,000 J per particle), distances of
about 10 to 30 m can be probed. Such energies are needed to test the theory directly, but these are about 1010 times higher than
the maximum energy associated with the LHC, and the distances are about 10 to 12 smaller than any structure we have direct
knowledge of. This would be the realm of various GUTs, of which there are many, since there is no constraining evidence at these
energies and distances. Past experience has shown that anytime you probe so many orders of magnitude further, you find the
unexpected.
While direct evidence of a GUT is not presently possible, that does not rule out the ability to assess a GUT through an indirect
process. Current GUTs require various other events as a consequence of their theory. Some GUTs require the existence of
magnetic monopoles, very massive individual north- and south-pole particles, which have not yet been proven to exist, while
others require the use of extra dimensions. However, not all theories result in the same consequences. For example, disproving
the existence of magnetic monopoles will not disprove all GUTs. Much of the science we accept in our everyday lives is based on
different models, each with their own strengths and limitations. Although a particular model may have drawbacks, that does not
necessarily mean that it should be discounted completely.
One consequence of GUTs that can theoretically be assessed is proton decay. Multiple current GUTs hypothesize that the stable
proton should actually decay at a lifetime of 1031 years. While this time is incredibly large (keep in mind that the age of the
universe is less than 14 billion years), scientists at the Super-Kamiokande in Japan have used a 50,000-ton tank of water to
search for its existence. The decay of a single proton in the Super-Kamiokande tank would be observed by a detector, thereby
providing support for the predicting GUT model. However, as of 2014, 17 years into the experiment, decay is yet to be found. This
time span equates to a minimum limit on proton life of
years. While this result certainly does not support many
grand unifying theories, an acceptable model may still exist.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

The Super-Kamiokande experiment is a clever use of proportional reasoning. Because it is not feasible to test for 1031 years in
order for a single proton to decay, scientists chose instead to manipulate the proton–time ratio. If one proton decays in 1031

791

792

Chapter 23 • Particle Physics

years, then in one year 10−31 protons will decay. With this in mind, if scientists wanted to test the proton decay theory in one
year, they would need 1031 protons. While this is also unfeasible, the use of a 50,000-ton tank of water helps to bring both the
wait time and proton number to within reason.

The Standard Model and the Big Bang
Nature is full of examples where the macroscopic and microscopic worlds intertwine. Newton realized that the nature of gravity
on Earth that pulls an apple to the ground could explain the motion of the moon and planets so much farther away. Decays of
tiny nuclei explain the hot interior of the Earth. Fusion of nuclei likewise explains the energy of stars. Today, the patterns in
particle physics seem to be explaining the evolution and character of the universe. And the nature of the universe has
implications for unexplored regions of particle physics.
In 1929, Edwin Hubble observed that all but the closest galaxies surrounding our own had a red shift in their hydrogen spectra
that was proportional to their distance from us. Applying the Doppler Effect, Hubble recognized that this meant that all galaxies
were receding from our own, with those farther away receding even faster. Knowing that our place in the universe was no more
unique than any other, the implication was clear: The space within the universe itself was expanding. Just like pen marks on an
expanding balloon, everything in the universe was accelerating away from everything else.
Figure 23.21 shows how the recession of galaxies looks like the remnants of a gigantic explosion, the famous Big Bang.
Extrapolating backward in time, the Big Bang would have occurred between 13 and 15 billion years ago, when all matter would
have been at a single point. From this, questions instantly arise. What caused the explosion? What happened before the Big
Bang? Was there a before, or did time start then? For our purposes, the biggest question relating to the Big Bang is this: How
does the Big Bang relate to the unification of the fundamental forces?

Figure 23.21 Galaxies are flying apart from one another, with the more distant ones moving faster, as if a primordial explosion expelled the
matter from which they formed. The most distant known galaxies move nearly at the speed of light relative to us.

To fully understand the conditions of the very early universe, recognize that as the universe contracts to the size of the Big Bang,
changes will occur. The density and temperature of the universe will increase dramatically. As particles become closer together,
they will become too close to exist as we know them. The high energies will create other, more unusual particles to exist in
greater abundance. Knowing this, let’s move forward from the start of the universe, beginning with the Big Bang, as illustrated
in Figure 23.22.

23.3 • The Unification of Forces

Figure 23.22 The evolution of the universe from the Big Bang onward (from left to right) is intimately tied to the laws of physics, especially
those of particle physics at the earliest stages. Theories of the unification of forces at high energies may be verified by their shaping of the
universe and its evolution.

The Planck Epoch

—Though scientists are unable to model the conditions of the Planck Epoch in the laboratory,

GeV necessary to unify gravity
speculation is that at this time compressed energy was great enough to reach the immense
with all other forces. As a result, modern cosmology suggests that all four forces would have existed as one force, a hypothetical
superforce as suggested by the Theory of Everything.
The Grand Unification Epoch

—As the universe expands, the temperatures necessary to maintain the

superforce decrease. As a result, gravity separates, leaving the electroweak and strong nuclear forces together. At this time, the
electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces are identical, matching the conditions requested in the Grand Unification Theory.
The Inflationary Epoch

—The separation of the strong nuclear force from the electroweak force during

this time is thought to have been responsible for the massive inflation of the universe. Corresponding to the steep diagonal line
on the left side of Figure 23.22, the universe may have expanded by a factor of
or more in size. In fact, the expansion was so
great during this time that it actually occurred faster than the speed of light! Unfortunately, there is little hope that we may be
GeV, vastly greater than the limits of modern
able to test the inflationary scenario directly since it occurs at energies near
accelerators.
The Electroweak Epoch

—Now separated from both gravity and the strong nuclear force, the electroweak

force exists as a singular force during this time period. As stated earlier, scientists are able to create the energies at this stage in
the universe’s expansion, needing only 100 GeV, as shown in Figure 23.20. W and Z bosons, as well as the Higgs boson, are
released during this time.
The Quark Era

—During the Quark Era, the universe has expanded and temperatures have decreased to the

793

794

Chapter 23 • Particle Physics

point at which all four fundamental forces have separated. Additionally, quarks began to take form as energies decreased.
As the universe expanded, further eras took place, allowing for the existence of hadrons, leptons, and photons, the fundamental
particles of the standard model. Eventually, in nucleosynthesis, nuclei would be able to form, and the basic building blocks of
atomic matter could take place. Using particle accelerators, we are very much working backwards in an attempt to understand
the universe. It is encouraging to see that the macroscopic conditions of the Big Bang align nicely with our submicroscopic
particle theory.

SECTION SUMMARY
23.1 The Four Fundamental Forces
• The four fundamental forces are gravity, the
electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, and the
strong nuclear force.
• A variety of particle accelerators have been used to
explore the nature of subatomic particles and to test
predictions of particle theories.

23.2 Quarks
• There are three types of fundamental
particles—leptons, quarks, and carrier particles.
• Quarks come in six flavors and three colors and occur
only in combinations that produce white.
• Hadrons are thought to be composed of quarks, with
baryons having three quarks and mesons having a
quark and an antiquark.
• Known particles can be divided into three major
groups—leptons, hadrons, and carrier particles (gauge
bosons).
• All particles of matter have an antimatter counterpart
that has the opposite charge and certain other quantum

numbers. These matter–antimatter pairs are otherwise
very similar but will annihilate when brought together.
• The strong force is carried by eight proposed particles
called gluons, which are intimately connected to a
quantum number called color—their governing theory
is thus called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Taken
together, QCD and the electroweak theory are widely
accepted as the Standard Model of particle physics.

23.3 The Unification of Forces
• Attempts to show unification of the four forces are
called Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) and have been
partially successful, with connections proven between
EM and weak forces in electroweak theory.
• Unification of the strong force is expected at such high
energies that it cannot be directly tested, but it may
have observable consequences in the as-yet-unobserved
decay of the proton. Although unification of forces is
generally anticipated, much remains to be done to
prove its validity.

18. The gravitational force is considered a very weak force.
Yet, it is strong enough to hold Earth in orbit around the
Sun. Explain this apparent disparity.
a. At the level of the Earth-to-Sun distance, gravity is
the strongest acting force because neither the
strong nor the weak nuclear force exists at this
distance.
b. At the level of the Earth-to-Sun distance, gravity is
the strongest acting force because both the strong
and the weak nuclear force is minimal at this
distance.

a. false
b. true
20. Why is a stationary target considered inefficient in a
particle accelerator?
a. The stationary target recoils upon particle strike,
thereby transferring much of the particle’s energy
into its motion. As a result, a greater amount of
energy goes into breaking the particle into its
constituent components.
b. The stationary target contains zero kinetic energy,
so it requires more energy to break the particle into
its constituent components.
c. The stationary target contains zero potential
energy, so it requires more energy to break the
particle into its constituent components.

transferring much of the particle’s energy into its

69. If the strong attractive force is the greatest of the four
fundamental forces, are all masses fated to combine
together at some point in the future? Explain.
a. No, the strong attractive force acts only at

distances. As a result, only masses far enough apart
will combine.
c. Yes, the strong attractive force acts at any distance.
As a result, all masses are fated to combine
together at some point in the future.
